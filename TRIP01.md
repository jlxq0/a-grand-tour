## Key Safety Decisions

### 1. Skip Balochistan (Ship Car)
**Risk:** Active insurgency (Balochistan Liberation Army), kidnapping, recent attacks on foreigners.

**Solution:** Ship car from Bandar Abbas (Iran) to Karachi (Pakistan). Family flies separately (RoRo ships don't carry passengers).

**Cost:** $1,500-2,500 | **Duration:** 3-5 days

### 2. Skip Kashmir (Use Manali-Leh Route)
**Risk:** India-Pakistan conflict zone, UK FCDO advises against travel.

**Solution:** Enter India at Amritsar, drive via Chandigarh to Manali, then Manali-Leh highway through safe Himachal Pradesh. Avoids Srinagar-Leh route through Kashmir entirely.

### 3. Iraq Safety
**Reality:** Southern Iraq (Basra, Ur) is relatively safe. Many overlanders now transit with families. Professional checkpoint system, local hospitality. Main risk is bureaucracy, not violence.
