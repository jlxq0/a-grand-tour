This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"A Grand Tour" - Planning documentation for a 15-year around-the-world overland expedition (2027-2042) with a Toyota Land Cruiser 300. Covers 100+ countries across 6 continents.

## Repository Structure

- `overview.md` - Master planning document with routes, schedules, vehicle specs, and budget
- Route data files (GeoJSON/KML) will be added per-trip as planning progresses

## Structure

21 trips split across two phases:
- **Phase A (2027-2034):** 13 four-month trips with 3-month breaks (pre-school)
- **Phase B (2035-2042):** 8 seven-week summer trips (school years)

Route: Dubai → East → Americas → West → Dubai (full circumnavigation)

## Mapping Tools

- Mapbox API for visualization and routing
- GeoJSON as primary format for route data
- Preference for scenic routes over highways when planning detailed segments
