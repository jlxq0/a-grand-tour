New Zealand's biosecurity is among the world's strictest—ensure the vehicle is spotless before shipping from Townsville.

Morning devoted to vehicle clearance—MPI (Ministry for Primary Industries) inspects all vehicles for biological risks. Once cleared, explore Auckland: the Sky Tower for 360-degree views, Viaduct Harbour's restaurants, the volcanic cone of Mount Eden for city panoramas. New Zealand awaits.
