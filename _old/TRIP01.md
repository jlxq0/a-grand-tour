- Morning: Pick up Land Cruiser from build shop, final inspection
- Afternoon: Test drive, pack vehicle
- Evening: Burj Khalifa sunset, farewell dinner

Dubai serves as the expedition's starting point, chosen for its established 4x4 customization industry and position at the gateway to the Arabian Peninsula. The city's modern infrastructure makes it ideal for final vehicle preparation and provisioning before heading into more remote regions.

Final vehicle inspection and handover from the build shop, followed by a test drive to verify all modifications. Evening at Burj Khalifa for sunset views over the city. February temperatures average 18-26°C with minimal chance of rain - ideal conditions for the journey's start.

- Evening: Khor Fakkan beach, first camp preparations check

Khor Fakkan is a natural deep-water port on the Gulf of Oman, separated from the rest of the UAE by the Hajar Mountains. It's one of the oldest settlements in the region, with archaeological evidence of habitation dating back 4,000 years. The town belongs to Sharjah emirate despite being geographically isolated from it.

Short driving day through Sharjah and across the Hajar Mountain pass. The coast road offers first views of the dramatic mountain scenery that continues into Oman. Evening on the beach to test camping gear before the first wild camp. February coastal temperatures around 20-28°C, sea temperature suitable for swimming.

- Afternoon: Khasab, dhow cruise through fjords
- Evening: Wild camp with fjord views

The Musandam Peninsula is an Omani exclave separated from the rest of the country by UAE territory. The coastline is often called the "Norway of Arabia" - steep limestone cliffs plunge directly into the Strait of Hormuz, creating a series of narrow fjords (khors) that extend kilometers inland. Dolphins are common in these waters, and the area sees significant tanker traffic transiting the strait.

Drive north along the coast to Dibba, then cross into Oman at the Musandam border. Afternoon dhow cruise through Khor ash-Sham, the largest fjord, watching for dolphins. First wild camp of the trip on a gravel beach with fjord views. February brings calm seas and clear skies, temperatures 18-25°C.

Sohar was once one of the most important ports in the Islamic world, controlling trade routes between the Gulf and East Africa. Legend holds it as the birthplace of Sinbad the Sailor. The city declined after the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century but has recently grown as an industrial port. The old souq and fish market retain traditional character.

Longer driving day south from Musandam, exiting Oman into UAE and re-entering Oman proper at the mainland border. The route follows the Gulf of Oman coastline through a string of fishing villages.

Muscat has been Oman's capital since the 1790s, though the area has been inhabited for at least 6,000 years. The city is constrained by mountains and spreads along the coast in a series of distinct districts. Unlike other Gulf capitals, Muscat has strict building codes limiting height and requiring traditional architectural elements, giving it a cohesive low-rise appearance.

Morning drive along the coast highway to Muscat. Afternoon visit to Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque - completed in 2001, it holds the world's second-largest hand-woven carpet (4,343 square meters). Evening at Muttrah Souq, one of the oldest markets in the Arab world, followed by a walk along the corniche. February weather ideal: 20-27°C, sunny.

Old Muscat occupies a natural harbor surrounded by mountains, fortified since the Portuguese built Forts Jalali and Mirani in the 1580s. The area remained the country's administrative center until Sultan Qaboos moved government functions to newer districts. Al Alam Palace, the Sultan's ceremonial residence, sits between the two forts along the waterfront.

Full rest day to explore Muscat. Morning at the Royal Opera House district - the opera house itself opened in 2011 and is one of the finest in the Middle East.

- Evening: Camp near wadi

Wadi Shab ("gorge between cliffs" in Arabic) cuts through the Eastern Hajar Mountains to the sea.

The wadi terminates in a cave with a waterfall that can only be reached by swimming through narrow channels.

Short morning drive south along the coast highway. The hike into Wadi Shab begins with a boat crossing, then follows the canyon upstream for about 45 minutes. The final section requires swimming through rock channels to reach the cave waterfall - bring dry bags for cameras. Wild camp near the wadi entrance.

Nizwa was Oman's capital in the 6th and 7th centuries and remains the country's spiritual heartland. The massive 17th-century fort dominates the old town, its circular tower 30 meters in diameter and 36 meters tall. The adjacent souq is one of the most traditional in Oman, particularly known for silverwork, pottery, and the Friday livestock market.

Drive inland from the coast, climbing through the Hajar Mountains to Nizwa at 500m elevation. Afternoon exploring the fort and souq - the Nizwa souq is less touristy than Muttrah and offers better prices on Omani silver. Traditional dinner of shuwa (slow-cooked lamb) if available. Temperatures cooler than the coast: 15-25°C.

- Evening: Mountain sunset, cool temperatures

Jebel Akhdar ("Green Mountain") rises to 2,980m in the Western Hajar range. The plateau receives more rainfall than the rest of Oman, supporting terraced agriculture of pomegranates, walnuts, and Damask roses. The rose harvest in March-April produces rose water used throughout the Gulf. Villages here have been continuously inhabited for over 4,000 years.

The road to Jebel Akhdar is restricted to 4WD vehicles - police check at the base. The ascent winds through dramatic gorges before reaching the plateau at 2,000m. Afternoon walking through terraced villages and rose gardens. Temperatures significantly cooler at altitude: 8-18°C in February, cold at night. Bring layers.

---

### Day 10: Jebel Akhdar → Jebel Shams — *February 10, 2027*

Jebel Shams is Oman's highest peak at 3,009m. The mountain's main attraction is Wadi Ghul, a 1,000-meter deep canyon often compared to the Grand Canyon. The canyon walls reveal 500 million years of geological history in exposed limestone layers. An abandoned village clings to a ledge partway down - reportedly abandoned when the last permanent resident died in the 1990s.

Challenging driving day on rough mountain roads. Descend Jebel Akhdar and drive through Wadi Bani Awf - one of Oman's most scenic mountain routes. The final ascent to Jebel Shams is steep and rocky.

The Balcony Walk is a 4km trail carved into the cliff face 200m below the rim, leading to the abandoned village of As Sab. The path was the only access to the village before it was abandoned. Petroglyphs along the route suggest the trail has been in use for thousands of years. The views into the canyon are vertigo-inducing.

Morning hike on the Balcony Walk - allow 3-4 hours round trip. The trail is exposed but not technically difficult; sturdy footwear essential. Afternoon for photography and relaxation. Second night camping at the rim. Temperatures similar to previous day; clear skies typical for February.

The landscape transitions from mountain to gravel desert to sand dunes as the road approaches Dhofar region. Salalah itself is geographically and culturally distinct from northern Oman, receiving monsoon rains from June to September that turn the hills green.

Two long driving days on Highway 31. Day 12: Descend from Jebel Shams and drive south through increasingly arid terrain. Wild camp off the highway - flat gravel desert with no facilities.

Al Baleed was one of these ports, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was also the birthplace of Sultan Qaboos, who transformed Oman from an isolated medieval state into a modern nation.

Rest day exploring Dhofar. Morning at the Land of Frankincense museum and Al Baleed archaeological site. Afternoon drive to Mughsail Beach to see the blowholes - sea caves that shoot water skyward when waves hit.

Yazd is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on Earth, settled for over 5,000 years. Its location between the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts made it a vital Silk Road trading post. The city is famous for its wind towers (badgirs) - ancient air conditioning systems that capture breezes and funnel them into buildings. Yazd is also the center of Iran's Zoroastrian community, followers of the pre-Islamic Persian religion.

| **Driving** | 8.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bandar Abbas |

- Long driving day south to Persian Gulf
- Scenery changes from mountains to coastal
- Evening: Port city, arrange shipping

Bandar Abbas is Iran's largest port and has been a major trading hub since the Portuguese established a base here in the early 1500s. The city sits on the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil passes. The climate is tropical, distinctly different from the Iranian plateau. The port handles the majority of Iran's container traffic and is the departure point for ferries to Hormuz Island and the UAE.

Long driving day descending from Shiraz through the Zagros Mountains to sea level. The road is good but winding in sections; the landscape transforms from highland plateau to subtropical coast.

| **Stay** | Hotel - Bandar Abbas |

- Leave car at port (loading onto ship)
- Ferry to Hormuz Island (20 min)
- Rainbow Valley: 70+ mineral colors
- Red Beach, Salt Goddess Cave
- Return ferry evening

Hormuz Island is a small Iranian island at the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, just 8km long. The island is famous for its extraordinarily colorful soil - over 70 different mineral colors create a surreal landscape. The Portuguese built a fortress here in the 16th century to control Gulf trade. Local soil is so iron-rich that it's edible and used as a spice in local cooking. The island remained an important trading post until the British built ports on the mainland.

Drop the Land Cruiser at the shipping agent for loading onto the cargo ship to Karachi. Take the morning ferry (20 minutes) to Hormuz Island. Explore by rented tuk-tuk or bicycle: Rainbow Valley's multicolored mountains, Red Beach (iron oxide sand), and the Salt Goddess Cave. Return ferry in the afternoon. March temperatures 28-35°C; bring sun protection and plenty of water.

### Day 43-46: Shipping — *March 15-18, 2027*
**Bandar Abbas → Karachi**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ship** | 3-5 days |
| **Family** | Fly Dubai → Karachi |

- Car on RoRo cargo ship
- Family flies (passengers not allowed on cargo)
- Meet in Karachi

The sea crossing from Iran to Pakistan is necessary because the overland border at Taftan/Mirjaveh traverses some of Pakistan's most dangerous territory in Balochistan. Cargo shipping avoids this risk and is straightforward to arrange through agents in Bandar Abbas. The route crosses approximately 900km of the Arabian Sea. RoRo (roll-on/roll-off) ships are the standard method; passenger travel on cargo vessels is not permitted.

The vehicle crosses on a cargo ship while the family flies via Dubai to Karachi - direct Iran-Pakistan flights are limited. Use the transit days to rest and handle logistics. Flight routing through Dubai allows a brief stopover if desired. March weather in Karachi upon arrival: 22-32°C, dry season before the monsoon.

Karachi is Pakistan's largest city and economic capital, home to over 16 million people. The city was a small fishing village until the British developed it as a port in the 1840s; it served as Pakistan's first capital at independence in 1947. Karachi handles 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade. The city is chaotic and sprawling but has pockets of colonial architecture and a vibrant food scene.

Reunite with the Land Cruiser at Karachi Port - customs clearance with the Carnet typically takes half a day. Inspect the vehicle after the sea crossing and address any issues. If time permits, afternoon visit to Clifton Beach and Mohatta Palace Museum in the historic Defence area. March temperatures 24-32°C, dry and dusty.

- Motorway drive to Islamabad
- Afternoon: Faisal Mosque
- Evening: Prepare for KKH adventure

Islamabad is one of the world's newest capital cities, purpose-built in the 1960s to replace Karachi as Pakistan's capital. The city was designed on a grid system against the backdrop of the Margalla Hills, foothills of the Himalayas. Faisal Mosque, completed in 1986, was the world's largest mosque until 1993 and remains the largest in South Asia. Its striking modern design resembles a desert Bedouin tent.

Easy drive north on the M2 Motorway, one of Pakistan's best roads. Arrive Islamabad by lunchtime. Afternoon visit to Faisal Mosque - the white marble structure against the green hills is striking.

The Karakoram Highway (KKH) is one of the world's most spectacular and challenging roads, running 1,300km from Islamabad to Kashgar in China. Construction took 20 years (1959-1979) and cost over 1,000 workers' lives due to landslides and accidents. The highway crosses some of the world's highest mountain terrain, traversing the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush ranges. Road conditions vary seasonally due to landslides and winter closures.

Rest day for final KKH preparations. Morning vehicle service check at a reputable Islamabad garage - this is the last proper service facility before Gilgit. Stock up on water, snacks, and emergency supplies. Afternoon hike in the Margalla Hills for views over the city.

| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Besham |

- Depart Islamabad
- Through Abbottabad, enter KKH
- Dramatic Indus gorge begins
- Besham: Gateway to the north

The first section of the KKH climbs from Islamabad through Abbottabad, a British hill station at 1,200m named after Major James Abbott. After Mansehra, the highway enters the Indus gorge, where the road is carved into cliff faces above the churning river. Besham marks the transition from settled lowlands to the dramatic mountain territory ahead - from here, the landscape becomes increasingly rugged.

Early departure from Islamabad to beat traffic. The drive through Abbottabad is straightforward; the road quality changes once you enter the KKH proper after Mansehra. The Indus gorge section provides the first glimpse of what lies ahead - sheer cliffs, rushing water, and the precarious ribbon of road. Besham is basic but offers the last comfortable accommodation before Chilas. Late March temperatures: 15-25°C at Besham's elevation.

Three mountain ranges collide here: the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush. The road passes Shatial, where ancient rock carvings line the river banks - petroglyphs left by travelers on the Silk Road over millennia. Chilas sits at the foot of Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth-highest peak.

Challenging driving day through the deepest part of the Indus gorge. Road quality varies; expect sections under repair due to landslides. Stop at Shatial to see the Buddhist and pre-Buddhist rock carvings along the river. First views of Nanga Parbat (8,126m) appear as you approach Chilas. Accommodation in Chilas is basic. Late March temperatures at Chilas (1,200m): 12-24°C; clear weather is common this time of year.

Gilgit's bazaar is a good place to stock up on dried apricots and nuts from Hunza, and warm clothing for higher elevations.

Rest and acclimatization day at 1,500m before ascending to Hunza (2,400m). Morning visit to the Kargah Buddha carving - the cliff walk offers good views over Gilgit.

The valley was an independent princely state until 1974, ruled by the Mir of Hunza from Baltit Fort. The local Burushaski language is a linguistic isolate unrelated to any other known language. Hunza is famous for its apricots, long-lived population, and exceptional hospitality.

Short scenic drive from Gilgit into Hunza Valley. The road follows the Hunza River with Rakaposhi dominating the view ahead - stop at Rakaposhi Viewpoint for photos.

The pass lies on the watershed between the Indus and Tarim basin drainages. The border area is part of Khunjerab National Park, home to snow leopards, Marco Polo sheep, and ibex. Sost is the last Pakistani town before the border, where customs and immigration are processed (though the actual border is 80km further).

Early departure for the drive to Khunjerab Pass - the road climbs steadily from Karimabad through increasingly barren landscape. Stop at Sost if needed for permits. The final section to the border climbs through snowfields; altitude effects may be noticeable. Photos at the Pakistan-China border marker, then return to Karimabad same day. April temperatures at the pass: -5 to 5°C; bring warm layers. Snow is possible any time of year.

### Day 62-66: Return KKH — *April 3-7, 2027*
**5 days back to Lahore**

![Attabad Lake](data/pois/images/pk/attabad-lake-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total Distance** | 1,162 km |
| **Stay** | Gilgit, Chilas, Besham, Islamabad, Lahore |

- Day 62: Karimabad → Gilgit
- Day 63: Gilgit → Chilas
- Day 64: Chilas → Besham
- Day 65: Besham → Islamabad
- Day 66: Islamabad → Lahore

The return journey along the KKH offers a different perspective - descending from the high peaks back to the plains. The route retraces the outbound journey through the Indus gorge, allowing appreciation of scenery that may have been obscured by fatigue or road concentration on the way up. The final stretch from Islamabad to Lahore returns to familiar, easy motorway driving.

Day 62: Relaxed drive back to Gilgit, stopping at any viewpoints missed on the way up. Day 63: Gilgit to Chilas, reversing the mountain drive. Day 64: Through the Indus gorge to Besham. Day 65: Exit the mountains and drive to Islamabad - the contrast with the lowlands is stark. Day 66: Motorway to Lahore for the border crossing. Early April temperatures gradually warming: 10-25°C in the mountains, 25-35°C in the plains.

## Week 11-12: Into India

### Day 67: Lahore → Amritsar — *April 8, 2027*
**Wagah Border crossing**

![Golden Temple](data/pois/images/in/golden-temple-amritsar-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 58 km |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs (including border) |
| **Border** | Pakistan → India |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Amritsar (2 nights) |

- Morning: Wagah Border crossing
- Carnet stamped for India
- Afternoon: Golden Temple
- Most sacred Sikh site

The Wagah Border crossing is the only road link between India and Pakistan, splitting what was once a single Punjab. The crossing opened in 1959 but has been subject to closures during conflicts. Amritsar was founded in 1577 by the fourth Sikh Guru and is home to the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), Sikhism's holiest shrine. The temple is covered in 400kg of gold leaf and sits in a sacred pool; it welcomes visitors of all faiths.

Morning border crossing at Wagah - arrive early as the process can take 2-4 hours. Vehicle formalities include canceling the Pakistan Carnet and activating the India Carnet. Once through, drive directly to Amritsar (30km). Afternoon visit to the Golden Temple - remove shoes, cover head, and wash feet before entering. The langar (free community kitchen) feeds 100,000 people daily. April temperatures 25-38°C; the heat is building in the Punjab.

---

### Day 68: Amritsar — *April 9, 2027*
**Rest day**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Amritsar |

- Golden Temple sunrise
- Jallianwala Bagh memorial
- Punjabi food paradise
- Prepare for mountain roads

Jallianwala Bagh is the site of the 1919 massacre where British troops fired on a peaceful gathering, killing at least 379 people (some estimates exceed 1,000). The walled garden is now a memorial; bullet holes remain visible in the walls. The event was a turning point in the Indian independence movement. Amritsar is also famous for its food - Punjabi cuisine is considered among India's best, featuring butter chicken, tandoori dishes, and parathas.

Second day in Amritsar. Early morning return to the Golden Temple for sunrise - the light on the gold is extraordinary. Visit Jallianwala Bagh nearby, a sobering but important site. Afternoon exploring the old city and eating: try the famous Kulcha at Bharawan da Dhaba or lassi at Ahuja. Evening rest and preparation for the mountain roads ahead. April temperatures 25-38°C; stay hydrated.

### Day 69: Amritsar → Chandigarh — *April 10, 2027*
**Modern India**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 228 km |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Chandigarh |

- Drive through Punjab farmland
- Chandigarh: Le Corbusier's planned city
- Rock Garden, Sukhna Lake
- Evening: Sector 17 market

Chandigarh is India's most unusual city - a modernist planned capital designed by Le Corbusier in the 1950s. The city serves as capital for both Punjab and Haryana states while being a Union Territory itself. The grid layout, numbered sectors, and brutalist architecture are unlike anywhere else in India. The Rock Garden, created secretly by a government official named Nek Chand from recycled materials, is now one of India's most visited sites.

Drive southeast through Punjab's wheat and rice fields - this is India's breadbasket. Arrive Chandigarh by lunchtime. Afternoon at the Rock Garden, a 25-acre fantasy landscape of sculptures made from broken bangles, electrical waste, and construction debris. Evening walk around Sukhna Lake and through Sector 17, the main commercial area. April temperatures 28-40°C; air-conditioned car and hotel essential.

---

### Day 70-71: Chandigarh → Manali — *April 11-12, 2027*
**Into the Himalayas**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 269 km |
| **Driving** | 6-7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Manali (2 nights) |

- Day 70: Drive through Kullu Valley
- Dramatic mountain scenery
- Manali: Tourist hub, hippy vibes
- Day 71: Rest day, Old Manali, prepare for Leh

The Kullu Valley has been settled for thousands of years and was once called Kulanthpitha ("End of the Habitable World") in ancient texts. Manali sits at 2,050m at the head of the valley, named after the sage Manu who is said to have meditated here. The town became popular with Western travelers in the 1960s and retains some of that counterculture character. Old Manali village, across the river, has a more traditional feel with wooden houses and temples.

Day 70: Leave Chandigarh early to beat the heat and traffic. The road climbs through the Shivalik Hills into the Kullu Valley, with increasingly dramatic scenery. The final stretch along the Beas River is particularly scenic. Arrive Manali late afternoon. Day 71: Rest day for acclimatization. Morning walk in Old Manali, visit Hadimba Temple, and afternoon preparing for the Leh crossing. April temperatures in Manali: 10-22°C, significantly cooler than the plains.

---

### Day 72-73: Manali → Leh — *April 13-14, 2027*
**Epic mountain crossing (2 days)**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 425 km |
| **Driving** | 10-12 hrs total |
| **Stay** | Day 72: Sarchu tents / Day 73: Leh |

- Day 72: Rohtang Pass (3,978m), Keylong, Sarchu
- High altitude camps
- Day 73: Tanglang La (5,328m - world's 2nd highest motorable pass)
- Afternoon arrival Leh

The Manali-Leh Highway is one of the world's great mountain roads, crossing five high passes above 4,000m. The road closes from October to May due to snow; late April is among the first weeks it opens each season. The route passes through the remote Lahaul and Spiti regions before crossing into Ladakh. Sarchu, the typical overnight stop, sits at 4,290m - altitude sickness is a real concern at this elevation.

Day 72: Early departure to cross Rohtang Pass (now bypassed by Atal Tunnel), then through Keylong and over Baralacha La (4,890m) to Sarchu. Sleep at basic tent camps - altitude effects may be felt strongly. Day 73: Continue over Nakee La, Lachulung La, and Tanglang La (5,328m) before descending to Leh (3,500m). Afternoon arrival allows time to rest. April temperatures highly variable: -5 to 15°C at passes, warmer in valleys. Carry warm layers, water, and altitude medication.

---

### Day 74-75: Leh — *April 15-16, 2027*
**Rest days - Acclimatize**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Leh |

- Essential acclimatization at 3,500m
- Leh Palace, Shanti Stupa
- Thiksey Monastery
- Magnetic Hill, Sangam (river confluence)

Leh was the capital of the Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh from the 17th century until its annexation by Kashmir in 1842. The town sits at the crossroads of ancient trade routes connecting Tibet, Central Asia, and the Indian plains. Ladakh is culturally Tibetan Buddhist, with a landscape of whitewashed monasteries perched on hilltops. Thiksey Monastery, 19km from Leh, is one of the largest in the region and resembles the Potala Palace in Lhasa.

Two essential rest days for acclimatization at 3,500m - rushing at this altitude risks serious illness. Day 74: Take it very easy; gentle walk to Shanti Stupa for sunset views, plenty of fluids. Day 75: If feeling well, morning visit to Thiksey Monastery for dawn prayers, afternoon at Leh Palace and the old town bazaar. Avoid alcohol and strenuous activity until acclimatized. Mid-April temperatures 0-15°C; cold nights, pleasant sunny days.

---

### Day 76-77: Leh → Manali (return) — *April 17-18, 2027*
**Return crossing**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 424 km |
| **Driving** | 10-12 hrs total |
| **Stay** | Day 76: Sarchu / Day 77: Manali |

- Same route back
- Different light, new perspectives
- Essential to cross before road closes

The return journey follows the same spectacular route in reverse, but the different direction of travel offers new perspectives on the landscape. Morning light on the Ladakh side, afternoon light descending toward Manali. The body is better acclimatized for the return, making the high passes less taxing. Late April is still early season; snow remains on the passes and weather can be unpredictable.

Day 76: Depart Leh and retrace the route over Tanglang La, Lachulung La, and Baralacha La to Sarchu. The drive feels different heading south - familiar landmarks appear in new contexts. Day 77: Continue through Keylong and over Rohtang to Manali. After the stark Ladakhi landscape, the green of Kullu Valley feels almost tropical. Mid-April temperatures similar to outbound journey; carry layers and emergency supplies.

---

### Day 78: Manali → Kaza (Spiti) — *April 19, 2027*
**Hidden valley**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 183 km |
| **Driving** | 7 hrs (rough roads) |
| **Stay** | Homestay - Kaza |

- Kunzum Pass (4,551m)
- Enter Spiti Valley - "Little Tibet"
- Kaza: Remote mountain town
- Key Monastery nearby

Spiti Valley is one of India's most remote regions, a cold desert at 3,800-4,500m elevation that was closed to foreigners until 1992. The valley is often called "Little Tibet" - culturally Tibetan Buddhist, it was historically part of the Guge Kingdom of Western Tibet. Spiti receives only 250mm of rainfall annually and has a harsh climate that supports minimal agriculture. Key Monastery, founded in the 11th century, clings to a hillside above the Spiti River.

Challenging driving day over Kunzum Pass (4,551m) into the Spiti Valley. The road quality varies dramatically; some sections are rough and the route may be closed by snow this early in the season - check conditions before departing. The landscape is lunar: barren mountains, minimal vegetation, and scattered Buddhist villages. Arrive Kaza late afternoon; homestay accommodation offers authentic experience. Late April temperatures in Spiti: -5 to 15°C.

---

### Day 79: Kaza → Shimla — *April 20, 2027*
**British hill station**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 413 km |
| **Driving** | 10 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Shimla |

- Long descent through Kinnaur
- Incredible mountain roads
- Shimla: Colonial charm, Mall Road

The route from Spiti to Shimla descends through Kinnaur, one of India's most spectacular mountain districts. The road passes through a succession of micro-climates: cold desert, pine forests, apple orchards, and finally mixed forests as it drops toward Shimla. Shimla was the summer capital of British India from 1864 to 1947; the colonial-era buildings, churches, and pedestrian Mall Road remain largely intact.

Very long driving day descending from Spiti through Kinnaur. The road along the Sutlej River is dramatic but requires concentration - sections are carved into cliff faces. Pass through Recong Peo and Rampur before the final climb to Shimla. Arrive late evening; the contrast between the barren Spiti landscape and Shimla's forests is remarkable. Late April temperatures in Shimla: 12-25°C, pleasant hill station weather.

---

### Day 80: Shimla — *April 21, 2027*
**Rest day**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Shimla |

- Christ Church, Ridge
- Toy train station
- Prepare for plains

Shimla's Ridge is the central promenade, a wide pedestrian space flanked by colonial buildings including Christ Church (1857), the second oldest church in northern India. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage narrow-gauge line, took 5 years to build (1898-1903) and covers 96km with 102 tunnels and 806 bridges. The town retains strong echoes of British India: Tudor buildings, bookshops, and a general air of gentility.

Rest day in Shimla after the long drive from Spiti. Morning walk along the Mall Road and Ridge, visiting Christ Church and browsing the old bookshops. The Kalka-Shimla railway station is worth seeing even without taking the train. Afternoon relaxation before the final push to Delhi. Late April temperatures 12-25°C; the hill station is filling with Indian tourists escaping the plains heat.

---

### Day 81: Shimla → Delhi — *April 22, 2027*
**Capital arrival**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 352 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Delhi |

- Descend to plains
- Temperature shock!
- Delhi: End of Trip 1

Delhi has been India's capital or near-capital for most of the last millennium, with seven different cities built on or near the present site. The current city contains historic monuments from the 12th-century Qutub Minar to Lutyens' New Delhi built in the 1920s. Delhi will be the endpoint for Trip 1 and the storage location for the Land Cruiser during the break before Trip 2.

Final driving day of Trip 1, descending from Shimla through Chandigarh to Delhi. The temperature increases dramatically as elevation drops - expect 35-42°C in Delhi versus 15-25°C in Shimla. The contrast with the mountain landscapes of the past weeks is striking. Arrive Delhi by late afternoon. Evening at leisure after completing the first leg of the journey. Vehicle to be stored at a secure facility until Trip 2 begins.

## Week 13: Buffer Days & Departure

### Day 82-84: Delhi — *April 23-25, 2027*
**Rest days / Buffer**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Delhi |

- Red Fort, Jama Masjid
- Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar
- Vehicle storage arrangements
- Buffer for delays/recovery

Delhi's major monuments span multiple dynasties: the Red Fort (1648) was the Mughal palace, Jama Masjid (1656) is India's largest mosque, Humayun's Tomb (1570) was the prototype for the Taj Mahal, and the Qutub Minar (1193) marks the beginning of Muslim rule in India. The city contains more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other Indian city. Buffer days are essential given the unpredictable nature of overland travel.

Three days in Delhi for rest, sightseeing, and vehicle handover. Day 82: Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Old Delhi, followed by lunch in the lanes of Chandni Chowk. Day 83: Humayun's Tomb and Qutub Minar in South Delhi. Day 84: Finalize vehicle storage arrangements, pack and organize equipment, last evening in India. Late April temperatures extreme: 38-45°C; stay air-conditioned during midday hours. These buffer days can absorb delays from earlier in the trip.

---

### Day 85: Fly Home — *April 26, 2027*
**Delhi → Singapore**

- SIA direct flight (5h 30m)
- Vehicle stored securely in Delhi
- End of Trip 1!

Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport handles over 70 million passengers annually and has direct connections to most major global cities. Singapore Airlines operates multiple daily flights to Singapore; the flight time is approximately 5.5 hours. The Land Cruiser will remain in secure storage in Delhi until Trip 2 begins in September 2027.

Final day of Trip 1. Morning transfer to Indira Gandhi Airport for the flight home to Singapore. The vehicle remains in Delhi, serviced and stored securely until the expedition resumes. Trip 1 covers 85 days and approximately 10,780 km across 10 countries - from the modern Gulf states through ancient Persia and along the mountain highways of Pakistan and India. Four months at home before Trip 2 begins.

## Key Safety Decisions

### 1. Skip Balochistan (Ship Car)
**Risk:** Active insurgency, kidnapping, recent attacks on foreigners.
**Solution:** Ship car Bandar Abbas → Karachi. Family flies separately.

### 2. Skip Kashmir (Use Manali-Leh Route)
**Risk:** India-Pakistan conflict zone, UK FCDO advises against travel.
**Solution:** Enter India at Amritsar, use Manali-Leh highway through safe Himachal Pradesh.

### 3. Iraq Safety
Southern Iraq (Basra, Ur) is relatively safe. Professional checkpoint system. Main risk is bureaucracy, not violence.
