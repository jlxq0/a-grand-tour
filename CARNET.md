## Security Options: Which Is Cheapest?

The carnet requires security of **200% of vehicle value** for the India/Pakistan route.

**Your vehicle:** ~SGD 140,000 (modifications/equipment typically don't count — just base vehicle)
**Required security:** SGD 280,000

### The Three Options

| Option | Capital locked? | Out-of-pocket cost | Refundable? |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Cash deposit** | SGD 280,000 with ATCUAE | None | Yes |
| **Bank guarantee** | SGD 280,000 in UAE bank | ~SGD 500 fee | Yes |
| **Insurance indemnity** | None | ~SGD 21,000 premium | No |

### 22-Month Cost Analysis

Assuming your investments normally return **7% per year**:

| Option | What happens to your SGD 280k | Earnings | Fees/Premium | Net cost |
|--------|------------------------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Cash deposit** | Sits with ATCUAE, earns nothing | SGD 0 | SGD 0 | **SGD 35,900** (opportunity cost) |
| **Bank guarantee** | Sits in UAE bank at ~3.5% | SGD 18,000 | SGD 500 | **SGD 18,400** (opportunity cost) |
| **Insurance indemnity** | Stays in your investments at 7% | SGD 35,900 | SGD 21,000 | **SGD 21,000** (premium paid) |

### The Verdict

| If your investments return... | Best option | Why |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----|
| < 4% | Bank guarantee | UAE bank pays similar, no premium lost |
| 4% - 7.5% | Bank guarantee | Difference doesn't cover premium |
| > 7.5% | Insurance indemnity | Investment gains exceed premium cost |

**For most people earning 5-7% on investments:** Bank guarantee wins by ~SGD 3,000.

**If you don't have SGD 280,000 to lock up:** Insurance indemnity is your only option — pay SGD 21,000 and keep your capital free.

### Important Notes

- UAE fixed deposits currently pay ~3-4% (Emirates NBD, HSBC, RAKBANK)
- Insurance indemnity premium varies by provider (5-10% of security value, using 7.5% here)
- If customs make a claim, you're liable regardless of which option you chose

## Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| **Mid-2026** | Apply online to Ajman Free Zone |
| **Late 2026** | One trip to UAE (~1 week): biometrics, licenses, buy car, register, get carnet |
| **Feb 1, 2027** | Depart Dubai — Trip 1 begins |
| **Nov 2028** | Return carnet after Trip 4 |
| **Dec 2028** | Bank guarantee cancelled, funds released |

---

## Why This Works

**The 6-month problem:** Normal UAE visas cancel if you're outside UAE for 180+ days. But **freezone investor visas are exempt** — your visa stays valid regardless of absence.

**Why Ajman:** Cheapest freezone (SGD 1,925 vs SGD 3,800+ for Dubai freezones). Same visa benefits.

## Countries Requiring Carnet

| Trip | Countries | Dates |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Pakistan, India | Feb - May 2027 |
| 2 | India, Nepal, Bangladesh | Aug - Nov 2027 |
| 3 | *(None — SE Asia doesn't require)* | Jan - Apr 2028 |
| 4 | Indonesia, Australia | Aug - Nov 2028 |

---

## How Long Should the Carnet Be?

Standard carnet is 12 months, renewable once = **24 months maximum**.

| Option | Carnet covers | Cash deposits needed | Feasible? |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **A** | Trips 1-4 up to Timor-Leste (20 months) | Australia + NZ | ✓ |
| **B** | Trips 1-4 including Australia (22 months) | NZ only | ✓ |
| **C** | Trips 1-5 including NZ (26 months) | None | ✗ Exceeds 24-month limit |

### Cost Comparison (Bank Guarantee Option)

Assuming SGD 280k bank guarantee at 3.5%, your investments return 7%:

| | Option A (20 mo) | Option B (22 mo) |
|---|---|---|
| Bank guarantee period | 20 months | 22 months |
| Bank guarantee cost | SGD 16,300 | SGD 18,000 |
| Australia deposit (SGD 44k × 2 mo) | SGD 500 | — |
| NZ deposit (SGD 16k × 2.5 mo) | SGD 230 | SGD 230 |
| **Total security cost** | **SGD 17,000** | **SGD 18,200** |
| Extra paperwork | Australia + NZ deposits | NZ deposit only |

**Australia cash deposit:** ~SGD 44,000 refundable (5% duty + 10% GST + 33% LCT)
**NZ cash deposit:** ~SGD 16,000 refundable

### Verdict

**Option B wins.** Keeping carnet through Australia saves only ~SGD 1,200 vs Option A, but avoids the hassle of a SGD 44,000 Australia deposit with LCT paperwork.

New Zealand cash deposit is unavoidable — carnet can't extend to 26 months.

## After the Carnet (2029+)

| Trip | Location | What to do |
|------|----------|------------|
| **5** | New Zealand | Refundable cash deposit (~SGD 16,000) with NZ Customs |
| **6-25** | Americas, Europe, Africa | No carnet — free Temporary Import Permits at each border |

---

## At the Border

1. Present carnet to customs
2. They stamp and keep the entry voucher
3. You keep the counterfoil as proof
4. At exit, they stamp the exit voucher
5. **Critical:** Ensure all stamps are complete — missing stamps trigger deposit claims
