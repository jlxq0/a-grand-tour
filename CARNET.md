# Carnet de Passage

A Carnet de Passage en Douane (CPD) is an international customs document that allows temporary import of a vehicle into foreign countries without paying import duties or taxes. It acts as a passport for your vehicle, guaranteeing that customs duties will be paid if the vehicle is not re-exported.

## Do We Need One?

**Yes, but only for the first ~22 months of the expedition (Trips 1-4).**

Based on the [Timeline](#timeline):

| Trip | Dates | Route | Carnet Required? |
|------|-------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Feb 1 – May 26, 2027 | Dubai → Gulf → Iran → Pakistan → India | **Yes** - Required for Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, India, Pakistan |
| 2 | Aug 1 – Nov 20, 2027 | India → Nepal → Bangladesh | **Yes** - Required for India, Nepal, Bangladesh |
| 3 | Jan 15 – Apr 19, 2028 | Thailand → Laos → Vietnam → Cambodia → Malaysia | **No** - Not required for land crossings |
| 4 | Aug 1 – Nov 24, 2028 | Singapore → Indonesia → Timor-Leste → Australia | **Yes** - Required for Indonesia. Australia included at end of trip. |
| 5 | Feb 1 – Apr 11, 2029 | New Zealand | **No** - Cash deposit alternative |
| 6+ | Aug 2029 onwards | Chile → All Americas → Europe → Africa → Dubai | **No** - Not required anywhere |

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Carnet (Feb 2027 - Nov 2028)

Obtain a ~22-month carnet from ATCUAE covering Trips 1-4:

**Countries requiring carnet on our route:**
- Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar (required)
- India, Pakistan (required - Category 1, 200% deposit)
- Nepal, Bangladesh (required)
- Indonesia (required)

**Australia** is included at the end of Trip 4 (arrives Brisbane via shipping from Timor-Leste). The carnet covers Australia, but a cash deposit alternative exists if preferred.

**Cost:** Bank guarantee annual premium of 2-5% of vehicle value (~$2,800-7,000/year for a $70k vehicle)

**Timeline:**
- Trip 4 ends: Nov 24, 2028 (in Australia)
- Ship Brisbane → Auckland: Nov 25 – Dec 1, 2028
- Close carnet and recover bank guarantee: Dec 2028

### Phase 2: Cash Deposit for New Zealand (Feb-Apr 2029)

Trip 5 is New Zealand only. Use temporary import with cash deposit instead of carnet:

- Apply to NZ Customs for Temporary Import Entry
- Cash deposit = import duties + GST
- Estimated: ~$10,000-15,000 USD
- Refunded when vehicle exported (shipping to Chile: Apr 12 – May 17, 2029)
- Requirements: Non-resident, vehicle stays registered in UAE, max 12 months

### Phase 3: The Americas & Beyond (Aug 2029+)

**No carnet required anywhere in the Americas, Europe, or Africa.**

- Trip 6 (Aug 2029): Chile → Colombia
- Trip 7+ (2030 onwards): Central America, North America, Europe, Africa

Each country uses its own temporary import permit system (TIP), typically issued at the border with no deposit required.

## Obtaining the Carnet

### Issuing Authority

ATCUAE (Automobile and Touring Club of UAE)
- Location: ATCUAE Building, Al Wuheida Street, Al Mamzar, Dubai
- Website: [atcuae.ae](https://atcuae.ae/cpd-carnet-de-passage/)

### Requirements

1. Valid UAE residence visa
2. UAE-registered vehicle
3. Valid UAE driving license
4. Passport copy
5. Vehicle registration copy
6. Bank guarantee or cash deposit

### Bank Guarantee vs Cash Deposit

| Option | Upfront Cost | Tied-up Capital | Annual Cost |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Cash deposit | $140,000 (200% of $70k vehicle) | Yes | None |
| Bank guarantee | ~$2,000-5,000 | No | 2-5% premium ($2,800-7,000) |

**Recommendation:** Bank guarantee is more capital-efficient.

### Adding Additional Drivers

An additional driver can be listed on the carnet, but they must also have a valid UAE residence visa. This means both expedition members need UAE residency.

## Important Considerations

### Carnet Validity

- Typically issued for 12 months
- Can be renewed once for an additional year
- Must be returned to issuing organization when expired or no longer needed
- Deposit/guarantee released upon return

### Border Procedures

1. Present carnet at entry
2. Customs stamps the entry voucher (volet d'entrée)
3. Keep counterfoil as proof of entry
4. At exit, customs stamps the exit voucher (volet de sortie)
5. Ensure all stamps are complete to avoid deposit claims

### What Happens If You Don't Re-Export?

If the vehicle is not exported before the carnet expires:
- The issuing organization pays customs duties to that country
- They claim the deposit/guarantee from you
- Can result in losing 200% of vehicle value

### Loss or Damage

If carnet is lost:
- Immediately notify ATCUAE
- Report to local police
- Upon return to UAE, get vehicle inspected by transport authority
- Obtain Certificate of Location before deposit can be released
