# Detailed Itinerary

## Week 1-2: Top End

### Day 1: Darwin — *September 27, 2028*
**Vehicle reunion**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Darwin |

- Clear vehicle from port
- Quarantine inspection
- Darwin exploration
- Prepare for Outback

Darwin is Australia's tropical gateway, closer to Singapore than Sydney. The city was rebuilt after Cyclone Tracy devastated it on Christmas Day 1974. Today it's a modern, multicultural frontier town—the jumping-off point for exploring the Top End's national parks and the beginning of epic Australian road trips.

Morning devoted to vehicle clearance—hopefully straightforward if you cleaned thoroughly before shipping. Once the Land Cruiser is released, explore Darwin: the excellent Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, the waterfront precinct, and the famous Mindil Beach sunset markets (Thursdays and Sundays). Stock up on supplies for the outback ahead.

---

### Day 2: Darwin → Kakadu — *September 28, 2028*
**Australia's largest national park**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 250 km |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Stay** | Camping/Lodge - Kakadu (2 nights) |

- Drive to Kakadu
- Ubirr rock art
- Sunset at Nadab Lookout

Kakadu is Australia's largest national park, a UNESCO World Heritage site for both natural and cultural values. Aboriginal people have lived here continuously for over 65,000 years—the rock art at sites like Ubirr and Nourlangie documents thousands of years of human and animal history. The landscape varies from floodplains to sandstone escarpments to monsoon forests.

Morning drive to Kakadu, entering through the northern gate. Afternoon at Ubirr, one of the park's premier rock art sites—galleries of paintings spanning thousands of years depict animals, hunting scenes, and creator spirits. Climb to Nadab Lookout for sunset over the vast Nadab floodplain, a quintessential Top End experience. Camping or lodge accommodation in the park.

---

### Day 3: Kakadu — *September 29, 2028*
**Escarpments and billabongs**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Camping/Lodge - Kakadu |

- Nourlangie rock art
- Yellow Water cruise
- Jim Jim Falls (if accessible)
- Wildlife watching

Kakadu transforms with the seasons—the Dry (May-October) offers accessible roads and concentrated wildlife around waterholes; the Wet (November-April) brings spectacular storms and inaccessible areas. Yellow Water billabong is one of Australia's premier wildlife experiences, with crocodiles, water buffalo, jabiru, and countless other species.

Full day exploring Kakadu's highlights. Morning at Nourlangie for more extraordinary rock art against the backdrop of the Arnhem Land escarpment. Afternoon Yellow Water cruise—saltwater crocodiles glide past lotus-filled waters while birds congregate in thousands. If Jim Jim Falls is accessible (check road conditions), the hike to this 200-meter plunge pool is unforgettable.

---

### Day 4: Kakadu → Katherine — *September 30, 2028*
**Nitmiluk Gorge**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 280 km |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel/Camping - Katherine |

- Drive south
- Katherine Gorge (Nitmiluk)
- Sunset cruise

Katherine Gorge—known by its indigenous name Nitmiluk—is a series of 13 sandstone gorges carved by the Katherine River over countless millennia. The gorges form a spectacular system best explored by boat, with ancient rock art on the cliff walls and freshwater crocodiles sunning on the banks.

Drive south from Kakadu through savanna woodland to Katherine. Afternoon cruise or kayak through the first two or three gorges—the sandstone walls rise 70 meters on either side, their colors shifting in the afternoon light. Rock wallabies perch on impossibly steep ledges. This is Jawoyn country, and cultural tours explain the deep indigenous connection to this place.

---

### Day 5: Katherine → Kununurra — *October 1, 2028*
**Crossing to Western Australia**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 520 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Kununurra |

- Long drive west
- Cross WA border
- Lake Argyle (optional)

The drive from Katherine to Kununurra follows the Victoria Highway through remote cattle country, crossing from the Northern Territory into Western Australia. Kununurra is an agricultural town created in the 1960s when the Ord River was dammed to create Lake Argyle—Australia's largest artificial lake.

Long but straightforward driving day across vast landscapes. Cross into Western Australia (set your watch back 1.5 hours). Kununurra makes a good base for exploring Lake Argyle and the eastern Kimberley. If time permits, an afternoon swim at the Lake Argyle infinity pool—overlooking the enormous lake with its population of 35,000 freshwater crocodiles—is unforgettable.

---

### Day 6-7: Kununurra → Bungle Bungles — *October 2-3, 2028*
**Beehive domes**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 300 km to park |
| **Driving** | 4WD required |
| **Stay** | Camping - Purnululu (2 nights) |

- 4WD track to Purnululu
- Bungle Bungle Range
- Cathedral Gorge
- Echidna Chasm

The Bungle Bungle Range in Purnululu National Park was unknown to non-Aboriginal Australians until a TV film crew flew over in 1983. The distinctive beehive-shaped towers, striped orange and black by differential weathering of sandstone layers, create one of Australia's most extraordinary landscapes. The park requires 4WD access.

Two days exploring this unique UNESCO site. The 53 km track from the highway takes 2-3 hours in good conditions—check with park rangers before attempting. Day one: Cathedral Gorge, a natural amphitheater reached by walking through towering domes. Day two: Echidna Chasm, an incredibly narrow slot canyon only lit by the midday sun. Camping under stars in the Australian outback.

---

### Day 8-10: Bungle Bungles → Broome via Gibb River Road — *October 4-6, 2028*
**Legendary outback drive**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 700 km |
| **Driving** | 3 days (4WD required) |
| **Stay** | Stations/Camping along Gibb River Road |

- Australia's legendary 4WD route
- El Questro Station
- Gorges and swimming holes
- Cattle stations

The Gibb River Road is one of Australia's legendary outback tracks, running 660 km through the heart of the Kimberley from Kununurra to Derby. Originally a cattle road serving remote stations, it now attracts adventurous travelers seeking gorges, waterfalls, and genuine outback experience. The road requires high-clearance 4WD and is typically only open May-October.

Three days of 4WD adventure. Day one: El Questro Wilderness Park, with its gorges and thermal springs. Day two: Manning Gorge, Bell Gorge, and Galvans Gorge—each offering pristine swimming holes in spectacular settings. Day three: Complete the Gibb to Derby, then drive to Broome. Carry extra fuel, water, and supplies; this is remote country where self-sufficiency is essential.

---

### Day 11-12: Broome — *October 7-8, 2028*
**Pearls and sunsets**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Broome (2 nights) |

- Cable Beach sunsets
- Pearl heritage
- Dinosaur footprints
- Rest and resupply

Broome was built on pearling—for decades it supplied 80% of the world's mother-of-pearl. Japanese, Chinese, Malay, and Aboriginal divers worked (and often died) harvesting the valuable shells. Today Broome is famous for its spectacular Cable Beach sunsets, when camels walk along the 22 km stretch of white sand against a blazing sky.

Two days in Broome. The obligatory Cable Beach sunset, preferably from camelback. Visit the pearl showrooms and pearling museum to understand the industry that built this town. At very low tide, dinosaur footprints are visible on the rocks at Gantheaume Point—130 million years old. Resupply for the long coastal drive south.

---

### Day 13-14: Broome → Ningaloo Reef — *October 9-10, 2028*
**Coastal odyssey begins**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 1,200 km |
| **Driving** | 2 days |
| **Stay** | Exmouth (2 nights) |

- Day 67: Broome → Port Hedland → Tom Price area
- Day 68: Continue to Exmouth
- Coastal and mining country

The drive from Broome to Ningaloo Reef crosses some of Western Australia's most remote coast. The landscape shifts from red Kimberley pindan to the mining towns of the Pilbara and finally to the turquoise waters of Ningaloo. This is iron ore country—road trains carrying export wealth dominate the highways.

Two long driving days. The coastal route is longer but more varied than the inland highway. Pass through Port Hedland, one of the world's busiest ports, exporting millions of tons of iron ore annually. Continue south to Exmouth, gateway to Ningaloo Reef. The approaching coastline hints at the underwater paradise ahead—Australia's "other" great reef.

---

### Day 15-16: Ningaloo Reef — *October 11-12, 2028*
**Accessible reef paradise**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel/Camping - Exmouth area (2 nights) |

- World's largest fringing reef
- Whale shark swimming (seasonal)
- Turquoise Bay snorkeling
- Cape Range National Park

Ningaloo Reef stretches 260 km along Western Australia's coast—the world's largest fringing reef and one of the few places where you can walk directly from shore onto a major reef system. The reef is famous for whale shark encounters (March-August), manta rays, turtles, and exceptional coral diversity.

Two days at Ningaloo. Snorkel directly from the beach at Turquoise Bay, drifting in the current over pristine coral gardens. Visit Cape Range National Park's gorges, where red rocks meet turquoise water. If visiting in season (April-July), a whale shark snorkeling tour is a bucket-list experience—swimming alongside the world's largest fish. Manta rays are possible year-round.

---

### Day 17-18: Ningaloo → Perth — *October 13-14, 2028*
**Down the coast**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 1,250 km |
| **Driving** | 2 days |
| **Stay** | Perth (2 nights) |

- Day 71: Ningaloo → Geraldton
- Day 72: Geraldton → Perth via Pinnacles

The coastal drive from Ningaloo to Perth passes through increasingly green landscapes as the Mediterranean climate takes over from the tropics. Key stops include the Pinnacles Desert, where thousands of limestone pillars rise from yellow sand—remnants of an ancient forest long since decomposed.

Two days heading south. The landscape greens as you enter the Southwest—wheat fields and wildflowers (in spring) replacing red desert. Stop at the Pinnacles in Nambung National Park, walking among the eerie limestone formations. Arrive Perth, Western Australia's capital and one of the world's most isolated cities. Stock up and prepare for the long Nullarbor crossing ahead.

---

### Day 19: Perth — *October 15, 2028*
**WA's cosmopolitan capital**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Perth |

- Kings Park views
- Fremantle port town
- Swan Valley (optional)
- Prepare for Nullarbor

Perth consistently ranks among the world's most livable cities, its isolation fostering a distinct culture oriented toward Asia and the Indian Ocean rather than Australia's eastern capitals. Kings Park offers sweeping views over the city and river; Fremantle (25 km south) preserves a well-restored 19th-century port town atmosphere.

Full day in Perth. Morning at Kings Park, with its views over the city and extensive botanical gardens featuring unique Western Australian flora. Afternoon in Fremantle—the markets, maritime museum, and preserved Victorian streets are worth the short drive. Evening planning the Nullarbor crossing: fuel stops, water supplies, accommodation options. The next few days cross some of Australia's most remote highway.

---

### Day 20-22: Perth → Adelaide via Nullarbor — *October 16-18, 2028*
**Crossing the great emptiness**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2,700 km |
| **Driving** | 3 days |
| **Stay** | Roadhouses along Nullarbor |

- World's longest straight road
- Treeless plain
- Great Australian Bight
- Head of Bight (whale viewing)

The Nullarbor Plain is one of the world's largest single exposures of limestone, stretching 1,200 km across southern Australia. The Eyre Highway crosses it via what's claimed as the world's longest straight stretch of road (146 km). "Nullarbor" is Latin for "no trees"—accurate for much of the crossing.

Three days crossing the great emptiness. Fill up at every fuel stop—distances between them can exceed 200 km. The Great Australian Bight provides dramatic coastal scenery, with cliffs dropping sheer to the Southern Ocean. At Head of Bight (June-October), southern right whales calve in the sheltered waters—one of the world's best land-based whale viewing sites. Arrive Adelaide, gateway to Australia's southeast.

---

### Day 23: Adelaide — *October 19, 2028*
**Uluru detour begins**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Adelaide |

- City exploration
- Prepare for Outback detour
- Central Market
- Barossa Valley (optional)

Adelaide is South Australia's capital, a planned city of wide boulevards and parklands. Less frenetic than Sydney or Melbourne, it's known for festivals, wine regions (the Barossa Valley is close), and excellent food. The Central Market is one of Australia's largest undercover markets.

Day in Adelaide before heading inland. Explore the Central Market's produce stalls and food vendors. The Art Gallery of South Australia holds a significant collection of Australian art. If time permits, the Barossa Valley is just an hour away, with world-renowned wineries in a distinctly Germanic-settled landscape. Tomorrow: northwest toward the Red Centre.

---

### Day 24: Adelaide → Coober Pedy — *October 20, 2028*

| **Distance** | 845 km |
| **Driving** | 9 hrs |
| **Stay** | Underground hotel - Coober Pedy |

- Stuart Highway north
- Outback landscape
- Underground living

Coober Pedy is the opal capital of the world—a bizarre mining town where summer temperatures exceeding 40°C drove residents underground. Homes, churches, and hotels are carved into the earth, maintaining a constant 23°C year-round. The lunar landscape of mine tailings stretches to the horizon.

Long drive north on the Stuart Highway, the landscape becoming increasingly red and empty. Arrive Coober Pedy by evening and check into an underground hotel—a quintessential Outback experience. The constant temperature means blissful sleep after a hot day on the road. Evening walk through the moonscape of mine dumps and maybe an opal noodling session (searching through discarded tailings).

---

### Day 25-26: Coober Pedy → Uluru-Kata Tjuta — *October 21-22, 2028*
**The sacred heart**

| | |

| **Driving** | 7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Yulara (2 nights) |

- Day 79: Drive to Uluru area
- Day 80: Uluru and Kata Tjuta

Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) are the Red Centre's iconic landmarks—massive sandstone formations rising from the flat desert. Uluru is a single rock 348 meters high and 9.4 km around; Kata Tjuta comprises 32 domed rocks with a combined height of 546 meters. Both are sacred to the local Anangu people.

Day 79: Drive from Coober Pedy to Yulara, the resort village serving Uluru. Arrive in time for sunset at the Rock—watching Uluru's colors shift through the spectrum is transcendent. Day 80: Sunrise at Uluru (equally spectacular), then base walk around the rock learning about Anangu culture. Afternoon at Kata Tjuta, walking through the Valley of the Winds between the massive domes. This is Australia's spiritual heart.

---

### Day 27: Uluru → Alice Springs — *October 23, 2028*

- Kings Canyon (optional)
- Alice Springs

Alice Springs is the major town of Australia's Red Centre, population 25,000, serving a vast outback region. It was founded as a telegraph station in 1872 and remains isolated—the nearest cities are Adelaide (1,500 km) and Darwin (1,500 km). Indigenous art galleries showcase the world-renowned Western Desert art movement.

Drive back to Alice Springs via the Red Centre Way. Optional longer route includes Kings Canyon (Watarrka)—a spectacular gorge requiring a 6 km rim walk. Alice Springs offers resupply opportunities and a chance to explore indigenous art galleries and the historic telegraph station. The town has a unique character as an outback hub.

---

- Day 83: Port Augusta → Great Ocean Road

The long drive from Alice Springs to Australia's southeast crosses multiple climate zones—from Red Centre desert through the Flinders Ranges to Mediterranean South Australia and finally the temperate coast of Victoria. This is pure distance-covering, with scenery gradually greening.

Two long driving days returning to the coast. The Stuart Highway south to Port Augusta, then southeast through Adelaide's outskirts toward Victoria. Aim to reach the western end of the Great Ocean Road by evening of day 83, ready to drive this iconic route tomorrow.

---

### Day 30: Great Ocean Road — *October 26, 2028*

Melbourne consistently challenges Sydney for the title of Australia's most livable city. Its laneways hide street art, cafes, and bars; its sporting culture is unmatched (cricket, Australian rules football, tennis); and its arts scene is vibrant and varied.

Full day exploring Melbourne. Morning in the laneways—Hosier Lane's street art, the cafes of Degraves Street, the quirky shops of Fitzroy. Sports fans: Melbourne Cricket Ground tour (90,000 capacity) or Australian Open precinct. Evening in Fitzroy or St Kilda.

| **Stay** | Hotel - Canberra |

- Inland route to national capital

Canberra was purpose-built as Australia's capital in the early 20th century—a compromise between rival cities Sydney and Melbourne. The planned city features broad avenues, significant national institutions, and a surprisingly vibrant food and wine scene. The Australian War Memorial is one of the world's most moving war museums.

Drive the Hume Highway inland to Canberra. The Australian capital rewards a stop—the War Memorial tells Australia's military story with exceptional sensitivity, while Parliament House's architecture impresses. Evening exploring Canberra's underrated restaurant scene around Braddon or Kingston.

Sydney's beaches are integral to the city's identity. Bondi is the most famous, but the coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee passes equally beautiful beaches and dramatic cliff scenery. The Manly Ferry is Sydney's best public transport experience—a 30-minute harbor crossing with stunning views.

Full day exploring Sydney. Morning coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee—the clifftop path passes through six beaches in 6 km. Afternoon ferry to Manly and beach time, or head west to the Blue Mountains for eucalyptus forests and dramatic sandstone cliffs. Evening in Circular Quay watching the Opera House illuminate.

---

K'gari (Fraser Island) is the world's largest sand island—122 km long, with freshwater lakes, ancient rainforest growing in sand, and dingoes roaming free. The only access is by 4WD; the beach serves as the main highway. Aboriginal people call it K'gari (Paradise) and have lived here for at least 5,000 years.

Drive north to Rainbow Beach and board the barge to K'gari. The island requires confident 4WD driving—tides dictate beach travel, and sand conditions vary. Head to Lake McKenzie, a perched lake of impossibly blue water ringed by pure white silica sand. Camp or stay at one of the island's resorts.

Hervey Bay is Australia's whale watching capital—humpbacks rest in the calm waters from August to November during their southern migration. Agnes Water and the Town of 1770 mark the southern gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the spot where Captain Cook first set foot on Queensland soil.

Morning departure from K'gari, barging back to the mainland. Optional whale watching in Hervey Bay if visiting in season. Continue north to Agnes Water and the Town of 1770—the most southerly access point to the Great Barrier Reef. The small coastal community has a laid-back feel and good beach breaks for surfing.

Whitehaven Beach is consistently rated among the world's best beaches—7 km of brilliant white silica sand (98% pure) on Whitsunday Island. Hill Inlet lookout reveals the beach's famous swirling sand patterns where the tide shifts the silica. The surrounding reef offers excellent snorkeling.

Full-day boat trip into the Whitsundays. The journey to Whitehaven Beach takes about an hour through island-scattered waters. Land at the beach, walk to Hill Inlet lookout for the iconic view, then beach time on sand so fine it squeaks underfoot. Afternoon snorkeling at Hook Island or other reef locations. Return to Airlie Beach by sunset.

### Day 50: Townsville → Cairns via Mission Beach — *November 15, 2028*
**To the tropics**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 350 km |
| **Driving** | 4.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cairns (4 nights) |

- Coastal highway north
- Mission Beach cassowary country
- Tully—wettest town
- Cairns arrival

Mission Beach is a quiet stretch of coast where tropical rainforest meets the Coral Sea—one of the best places to spot endangered cassowaries. These 2-meter-tall flightless birds roam between beach and forest. Beyond Tully (Australia's wettest town with 4 meters annual rainfall), the road winds through cane fields to Cairns.

Scenic drive through some of Queensland's most tropical landscapes. Stop at Mission Beach to walk the rainforest trails and look for cassowaries—Australia's largest native bird. Continue through Innisfail and Gordonvale, the cane fields giving way to Cairns' coastal sprawl. Check into accommodation in Australia's reef capital.

### Day 51: Great Barrier Reef — *November 16, 2028*
**World's largest reef system**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Boat tour (90 min each way) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cairns |

- Full-day reef tour
- Outer reef platforms
- Snorkeling and diving
- Marine life encounters

The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system—2,300 km long, visible from space, and home to 1,500 fish species, 400 coral types, and countless other marine creatures. Climate change threatens its future, making current visits both precious and poignant.

Full-day tour to the outer reef—the reef platforms here offer better visibility and coral health than inner reef sites. Snorkel over coral gardens, spot giant clams and sea turtles, perhaps take an introductory dive. Glass-bottom boats and underwater observatories offer non-swimming alternatives. Return to Cairns with the day's underwater memories.

### Day 52: Cairns — *November 17, 2028*
**Reef city exploration**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cairns |

- Kuranda Scenic Railway

The city's Esplanade lagoon provides free swimming.

Day trip to Kuranda—take the scenic railway up (historic train through spectacular gorges and waterfalls) and Skyrail down (6 km of rainforest canopy views). Kuranda village has markets and wildlife attractions. Return to Cairns for the Esplanade lagoon (essential in croc country where ocean swimming is inadvisable) and the night markets.

### Day 53: Cairns → Port Douglas → Daintree — *November 18, 2028*
**World's oldest rainforest**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 140 km |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Eco-lodge - Daintree (2 nights) |

- Great Barrier Reef Drive
- Port Douglas charm
- Daintree River crossing
- Rainforest immersion

The Daintree Rainforest is the oldest continuously surviving rainforest on Earth—at 180 million years, it predates the Amazon by 100 million years. This is one of the only places where rainforest meets reef, two World Heritage areas touching at Cape Tribulation. The Daintree River crossing marks entry into this ancient world.

Spectacular coastal drive north on the Great Barrier Reef Drive—one of Australia's best. Stop at Port Douglas, an upmarket resort town with Four Mile Beach and boutique shops. Cross the Daintree River by cable ferry and enter the rainforest. The atmosphere changes immediately—giant ferns, strangler figs, and the constant sound of birds.

### Day 54: Daintree & Cape Tribulation — *November 19, 2028*
**Where rainforest meets reef**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Eco-lodge - Daintree |

- Cape Tribulation beach
- Rainforest walks
- Night wildlife spotting
- Mossman Gorge

Cape Tribulation is where the Daintree Rainforest descends directly to Great Barrier Reef—an exceptional meeting of ecosystems. The beach, fringed by jungle, is one of Australia's most atmospheric. Endemic species abound, including the southern cassowary and tree-kangaroos.

Full day in the ancient rainforest. Walk to Cape Tribulation beach, where rainforest-covered mountains plunge to coral sand. Take boardwalk trails through the jungle, watching for cassowaries and Boyd's forest dragons. Visit Mossman Gorge for crystal-clear swimming holes. Evening: guided night walk to spot tree-kangaroos, cuscus, and other nocturnal creatures.

### Day 55: Daintree → Cairns — *November 20, 2028*
**Returning south**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 140 km |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cairns |

- Morning rainforest walk
- Return drive
- Cairns final evening
- Prepare for shipping

The road ends at Cape Tribulation—beyond lies the Bloomfield Track, a serious 4WD route to Cooktown and eventually Cape York. For this trip, we turn south, but the far north calls to adventurers: Cape York Peninsula, 1,000 km to Australia's northern tip, is one of the world's great 4WD expeditions (dry season only, 2-3 weeks required).

Final morning in the Daintree—perhaps a sunrise walk or croc-spotting river cruise. Drive back through the rainforest, stopping anywhere that caught your interest on the way up. Return to Cairns by afternoon. Final evening in North Queensland—the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree have delivered two of Australia's most precious natural experiences.

*Note: Cape York Peninsula—Australia's northernmost tip—lies 1,000 km beyond. It's one of the world's great 4WD adventures but requires 2-3 weeks and is only accessible in the dry season (May-October). Consider for a future expedition!*

### Day 56: Cairns → Townsville — *November 21, 2028*
**South to the shipping port**

| **Driving** | 4.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Townsville |

- Retrace coastal route south
- Mission Beach (second look)
- Townsville arrival
- Arrange vehicle shipping

Townsville is the most practical shipping port for vehicles heading to New Zealand from North Queensland. RoRo services operate from the Port of Townsville, saving the 1,350 km backtrack to Brisbane. The drive south retraces the tropical coast with opportunities to revisit favourite spots.

Drive south along the familiar coastal route. Stop at Mission Beach for another cassowary search, or explore any spots missed on the way north. Arrive Townsville and meet with shipping agents to finalize paperwork. The Port of Townsville handles vehicle exports—arrange delivery and prepare for the voyage to Auckland.

### Day 57: Townsville — *November 22, 2028*
**End of Trip 4**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Townsville |

- Deliver vehicle for shipping
- Export paperwork
- Magnetic Island day trip
- Final evening

Trip 5 ends here in Townsville with the vehicle shipped to Auckland for Trip 6. The Port of Townsville offers RoRo cargo services to New Zealand (~$2,800 AUD, 7-10 days transit). Shipping from here rather than Brisbane saves 1,350 km of backtracking.

Deliver vehicle to port, complete export paperwork. With the car handed over, take the ferry to Magnetic Island for a final Australian adventure—koalas in the wild, secluded beaches, and rock wallabies at sunset. Return to Townsville for a final dinner before flying home. Fly Singapore → Auckland when the vehicle arrives for Trip 6.
