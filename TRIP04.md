# Detailed Itinerary

## Part 1: Indonesia

### Days 1-2: JB to Jakarta via Batam

### Day 1: Johor Bahru — *August 1, 2028*
**Reunited with the Land Cruiser**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - JB |

- Retrieve car from storage
- Vehicle inspection after 3-month break
- Prepare for Indonesia crossing
- Evening in JB

After three months in secure storage following Trip 3, the Land Cruiser awaits in Johor Bahru. The storage facility near the causeway has kept the vehicle safe while you've been home processing photos and planning this next leg. Indonesia stretches ahead—thousands of islands, volcanic peaks, and eventually the vast Australian outback.

Full day dedicated to vehicle preparation. Check all fluids, tire pressures, battery health, and ensure nothing has deteriorated during storage. The upcoming Indonesian adventure requires everything in perfect working order. Evening gathering supplies and enjoying JB's last Malaysian meal before crossing into the Indonesian archipelago tomorrow.

---

### Day 2: JB → Batam → Jakarta — *August 2-3, 2028*
**Into the Indonesian archipelago**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferries only |
| **Ferries** | JB → Batam RoRo, Batam → Jakarta RoRo |
| **Stay** | Ferry overnight / Hotel Jakarta |

- Morning: JB → Batam RoRo ferry
- Afternoon: Clear Indonesian customs with Carnet
- Evening: Board Batam → Jakarta ferry
- Overnight crossing (~24 hrs)

The new Batam-Johor RoRo ferry service makes entering Indonesia with a vehicle remarkably straightforward. The crossing to Batam takes about two hours, depositing you in Indonesian waters where the Carnet de Passages comes into play. Indonesian customs can be thorough but generally efficient with proper documentation.

Morning boarding in JB for the short hop to Batam. Indonesian immigration and customs processing—expect thorough vehicle inspection and paperwork. The Batam to Jakarta RoRo ferry departs from Telaga Punggur port, an overnight journey of approximately 24 hours across the Java Sea. Basic cabins available; bring food and entertainment. Arrive Tanjung Priok (Jakarta's port) the following morning.

---

### Day 3: Jakarta — *August 4, 2028*
**Capital arrival and recovery**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jakarta |

- Morning: Arrive Tanjung Priok port
- Clear port formalities
- Rest and recover from ferry
- Explore Jakarta

Jakarta sprawls across the northwest coast of Java, a megacity of 30+ million people that serves as Indonesia's political and economic heart. The city's traffic is legendary—some of the worst in the world—but it also offers glimpses of colonial Dutch architecture, vibrant Chinatown, and the National Monument (Monas) piercing the skyline.

Arrival and port clearance in the morning. Jakarta's traffic makes driving here challenging, so consider leaving the car at the hotel and using ride-hailing apps to explore. The National Museum houses an impressive collection of Indonesian artifacts, while Kota Tua (Old Town) preserves Dutch colonial heritage. Evening preparing for the early ferry to Sumatra tomorrow.

---

## Week 1-3: Sumatra

### Day 4: Jakarta → Merak → Bakauheni — *August 5, 2028*
**Crossing to Sumatra**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 120 km + ferry |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Ferry** | Merak → Bakauheni (2 hrs) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bandar Lampung |

- Drive west to Merak ferry terminal
- Cross Sunda Strait to Sumatra
- Drive to Bandar Lampung

The Sunda Strait separates Java and Sumatra, a narrow channel bridged by frequent ferries running 24/7 between Merak and Bakauheni. The crossing takes about two hours, with departures every 30 minutes during peak times. This is one of Indonesia's busiest ferry routes, connecting the nation's two largest islands.

Early departure to beat Jakarta traffic heading west to Merak. The ferry terminal operates continuously; simply drive on, pay, and wait for departure. The crossing offers views of Krakatoa in the distance—the infamous volcano that exploded in 1883. Arrive Bakauheni and drive north to Bandar Lampung, Sumatra's southernmost major city. First night on the world's sixth-largest island.

---

### Day 5: Bandar Lampung → Palembang — *August 6, 2028*
**Trans-Sumatra Highway begins**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 450 km |
| **Driving** | 7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Palembang |

- Trans-Sumatra Highway north
- Oil palm plantations
- Arrive Palembang

The Trans-Sumatra Highway stretches 2,500 km from Lampung to Aceh, threading through jungle, plantations, and mountain ranges. Road conditions vary from excellent toll roads to challenging stretches requiring patience. Palembang, South Sumatra's capital, sits on the Musi River and was once the center of the powerful Srivijaya maritime empire.

Long driving day heading north on the Trans-Sumatra. The landscape shifts from coastal lowlands to endless oil palm plantations—Indonesia's controversial but economically vital crop. Palembang rewards arrival with its distinctive pempek fish cakes and the impressive Ampera Bridge spanning the Musi River. The city's Masjid Agung and floating market offer morning exploration.

---

### Day 6: Palembang → Jambi — *August 7, 2028*
**Through the plantation belt**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 350 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jambi |

- Continue north through plantations
- Cross Batang Hari River
- Jambi temples nearby

Jambi Province marks the transition zone between South and Central Sumatra, the landscape dominated by the Batang Hari River—Sumatra's longest waterway. The region holds remnants of the Melayu Kingdom, predating Srivijaya, with temple ruins at Muaro Jambi offering insight into pre-Islamic civilization.

Steady progress northward through increasingly remote territory. The Muaro Jambi temple complex, 26 km from the city, spreads across 12 square kilometers of parkland along the Batang Hari River—the largest temple complex in Southeast Asia by area. Evening in Jambi city, sampling local cuisine and preparing for the climb into the highlands tomorrow.

---

### Day 7: Jambi → Pekanbaru — *August 8, 2028*
**Continuing the East Route**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 320 km |
| **Driving** | 5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Pekanbaru |

- Trans-Sumatra east route
- Oil palm plantations
- Riau Province capital

Pekanbaru is the capital of Riau Province, grown wealthy from oil and palm plantations. The city marks the transition from southern Sumatra's lowlands to the hill country approaching Lake Toba. Unlike the scenic west coast route, the east route is faster and passes through Indonesia's agricultural heartland.

Steady progress north on the Trans-Sumatra Highway's eastern branch (Jalintim). The landscape is dominated by endless oil palm plantations—Riau is one of Indonesia's largest palm oil producing regions. Pekanbaru is a modern city with few tourist attractions but makes a convenient stopover. The east route saves a day compared to the scenic west coast, which we'll experience on the return journey.

---

### Day 8: Pekanbaru → Parapat (Lake Toba) — *August 9, 2028*
**Direct to the Supervolcano**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 380 km |
| **Driving** | 7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Parapat |

- Northwest into highlands
- Enter Batak territory
- First views of Lake Toba

Lake Toba is the largest volcanic lake in the world, formed by a supervolcanic eruption 75,000 years ago that caused a global volcanic winter. The lake is 100 km long, 30 km wide, and up to 505 meters deep. Samosir Island, nearly the size of Singapore, sits in its center—the resurgent dome of the ancient volcano.

Long drive from the lowlands into the highlands, climbing steadily as you leave Riau's plantations behind. The landscape transitions as you enter North Sumatra and Batak territory. The first glimpse of Lake Toba is unforgettable—its vast blue expanse stretching to distant volcanic peaks. Arrive Parapat as the sun sets over the massive lake, its scale hard to comprehend even from the shore.

---

### Day 9: Parapat → Samosir Island — *August 10, 2028*
**Island in the volcano**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferry + 30 km |
| **Driving** | 1 hr |
| **Stay** | Guesthouse - Samosir (2 nights) |

- Ferry to Samosir Island
- Traditional Batak villages
- Stone chairs of King Siallagan

Samosir Island is the heartland of Batak culture, particularly the Toba Batak subgroup. Traditional villages preserve the distinctive houses with their dramatic saddleback roofs, and stone furniture where kings once passed judgment remains in place. The island connects to the mainland by a narrow isthmus, though the ferry from Parapat is the typical approach.

Morning ferry from Parapat to Tomok or Tuk Tuk on Samosir. The island moves at a different pace—no traffic, minimal development, just traditional villages and rice terraces against the backdrop of the lake. Visit the stone chairs of King Siallagan, where executions once took place (the condemned were reportedly eaten afterward). Evening swimming in the volcanic waters and enjoying lakeside accommodation.

---

### Day 10: Samosir Island — *August 11, 2028*
**Batak culture immersion**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Guesthouse - Samosir |

- Batak Museum at Simanindo
- Traditional dance performance
- Circumnavigate island
- Hot springs

The Batak Museum at Simanindo preserves traditional Batak houses and hosts cultural performances featuring the distinctive percussion-heavy music and energetic dances of the Batak people. The dance once accompanied rituals including warfare and funerary practices; today it welcomes tourists while maintaining cultural authenticity.

Full day exploring Samosir. Morning Batak dance performance at Simanindo—the thundering drums and masked dancers are unforgettable. Drive around the island, stopping at viewpoints where the scale of Lake Toba becomes apparent. Afternoon at the natural hot springs, heated by the volcanic system that created this landscape. Final evening on the island, watching the sun set over the ancient caldera.

---

### Day 11: Samosir → Berastagi — *August 12, 2028*
**Highland volcanoes**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 180 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Berastagi |

- Ferry back to Parapat
- Drive to Berastagi highlands
- Twin volcanoes

Berastagi sits at 1,300 meters between two active volcanoes—Mount Sinabung and Mount Sibayak. The town serves as a base for trekking and offers cool temperatures year-round. Mount Sinabung remained dormant for 400 years before dramatically reawakening in 2010; it has been erupting intermittently since, sometimes closing nearby areas.

Ferry back to the mainland and drive north toward Medan, climbing into the Karo Highlands instead of descending to the coast. Berastagi's twin volcanic sentinels dominate the skyline. If Sinabung is calm, views of its steaming cone are impressive; if active, keep respectful distance. Evening in the cool mountain air, markets selling highland vegetables and fruits.

---

### Day 12: Berastagi → Medan — *August 13, 2028*
**To Sumatra's metropolis**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 66 km |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Medan |

- Optional: Sibayak volcano sunrise
- Descend to Medan

Medan is Sumatra's largest city, a sprawling metropolis of 2.5 million people that serves as the commercial hub for North Sumatra. The city preserves impressive colonial architecture from the Dutch era, including the Maimun Palace (sultanate residence) and the Great Mosque. It's also famous for its food, particularly Indian-influenced dishes and durian.

Optional pre-dawn climb of Mount Sibayak for sunrise—one of Indonesia's most accessible volcanic summits. Descend to Medan's tropical heat and explore the city's highlights: the ornate Maimun Palace, the impressive Great Mosque, and the colonial-era post office. Medan's cuisine is exceptional—try the biryani, gulai, and if you're brave, the famously pungent durian.

---

### Day 13: Medan — *August 14, 2028*
**Rest & exploration**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Medan |

- City exploration
- Colonial heritage
- Prepare for west coast journey

A rest day in Sumatra's metropolis. Medan rewards extended exploration—the ornate Tjong A Fie Mansion, the Art Deco-influenced Lonsum Building, and the lively Petisah Market. The city's diverse population has created a unique culinary scene blending Batak, Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences.

Sleep in after the highland driving. Explore neighborhoods missed yesterday—the old Chinese quarter around Kesawan Street, or the Tamil area near Sri Mariamman Temple. Evening at Merdeka Walk food court sampling Medan's famous martabak and soto Medan. Tomorrow begins the scenic west coast descent—a completely different route from the outbound journey.

---

### Day 14: Medan → Bukittinggi — *August 15, 2028*
**Crossing to the West Route**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 530 km |
| **Driving** | 10 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bukittinggi (2 nights) |

- Trans-Sumatra west route (Jalinbar)
- Highland scenery
- Arrive Minangkabau territory

The return journey takes the scenic west coast route (Jalinbar) through completely different landscapes than the outbound east route. The road climbs through the Barisan Mountains, offering dramatic volcanic scenery before entering the distinctive Minangkabau highlands—a different route provides twice the experience of Sumatra.

Long driving day crossing Sumatra's spine. The west route passes through highland towns and forested mountains, a stark contrast to the palm plantations of the east coast. Arrive Bukittinggi in the cool evening air, the distinctive horn-roofed architecture announcing entry into Minangkabau country. The next two days reward the long drive with cultural exploration.

---

### Day 15: Bukittinggi — *August 16, 2028*
**Minangkabau exploration**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bukittinggi |

- Pagaruyung Palace
- Traditional villages
- Lake Maninjau crater
- Sianok Canyon

Bukittinggi ("High Hill") sits at 930 meters elevation, the cultural heart of Minangkabau country. The world's largest matrilineal society has created a unique culture where property and family names pass through the female line. Their distinctive architecture—soaring horn-shaped roofs symbolizing water buffalo—dots the surrounding hills.

Full day exploring Minangkabau culture. Morning visit to the reconstructed Pagaruyung Palace, learning about the matrilineal traditions. Drive to traditional villages with clusters of rumah gadang (big houses). Afternoon descent to Lake Maninjau via the famous 44-bend road—an adventure itself. The Sianok Canyon offers sunset views before evening exploring Bukittinggi's charming town center and its iconic clock tower (Jam Gadang).

---

### Day 16: Bukittinggi → Padang — *August 17, 2028*
**To the coast**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 90 km |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Padang |

- Scenic descent to coast
- Padang city exploration
- Famous Padang cuisine

Padang is the capital of West Sumatra and birthplace of "Padang restaurants" found throughout Indonesia and Malaysia. The city sits on the Indian Ocean coast, a bustling port with colonial Dutch heritage. Padang cuisine—known for its bold flavors and the nasi padang served with multiple dishes—is among Indonesia's most famous.

Short but scenic morning drive from the highlands to the coast. The road winds down through dramatic scenery as elevation drops from 900 to sea level. Afternoon exploring Padang—the old Dutch quarter, the Chinese temple, and the coastal area. Evening feast at a traditional Padang restaurant where countless dishes arrive unsolicited; you pay only for what you eat. Try the rendang, gulai, and dendeng balado.

---

### Day 17: Padang → Bengkulu — *August 18, 2028*
**West coast route**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 350 km |
| **Driving** | 7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bengkulu |

- Coastal west route
- Fort Marlborough
- Sukarno exile site

Bengkulu was a British colony from 1685 to 1824—an anomaly in Dutch-dominated Indonesia. Fort Marlborough remains the largest British fort in Southeast Asia. The city was also where future president Sukarno was exiled by the Dutch; his home is now a museum. The drive along Sumatra's west coast offers ocean views and a sense of remoteness.

The west coast road hugs the Indian Ocean, passing through fishing villages and forest-covered hills. This is Sumatra at its least developed—few tourists venture here. Arrive Bengkulu and explore Fort Marlborough's massive walls, a monument to Britain's brief presence. Visit Sukarno's exile house, where Indonesia's founding father lived from 1938-1942. A unique stop on an unusual route.

---

### Day 18: Bengkulu → Bandar Lampung — *August 19, 2028*
**Final Sumatra leg**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 550 km |
| **Driving** | 10 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bandar Lampung |

- Continue west coast route
- Cross into South Sumatra
- Arrive Lampung

Long driving day completing the west coast descent. The road continues through remote territory, eventually turning inland to cross into Lampung Province. The landscape shifts from forested hills to lowland plantations as you approach Sumatra's southern tip.

Early departure for the long drive south. The west coast route is slower but more scenic than the east coast highway. Pack snacks—stops are infrequent. Arrive Bandar Lampung in the evening, completing the Sumatra loop via an entirely different route from the outbound journey. Tomorrow: the ferry back to Java.

---

### Day 19: Bandar Lampung → Jakarta — *August 20, 2028*
**Return to Java**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 120 km + ferry |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Ferry** | Bakauheni → Merak (2 hrs) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jakarta |

- Morning ferry to Java
- Drive to Jakarta
- Rest and prepare for Java leg

The return crossing from Sumatra to Java marks the end of the Sumatra expedition. Two weeks on the world's sixth-largest island, via two completely different routes—the fast east highway up, the scenic west coast down. Now Java's historical treasures and volcanic landscapes await.

Early ferry from Bakauheni, arriving Merak mid-morning. Navigate through Jakarta's suburbs to a hotel in the city center. The afternoon is for rest, vehicle maintenance, and perhaps revisiting any Jakarta sights missed on the first pass. Tomorrow begins the Java leg—shorter distances, more concentrated attractions.

---

## Week 3-4: Java

### Day 20: Jakarta → Yogyakarta — *August 21, 2028*
**Cultural heart of Java**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 550 km |
| **Driving** | 8 hrs (or train) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Yogyakarta (3 nights) |

- Cross Java
- Arrive Yogyakarta
- Sultan's Palace area

Yogyakarta (often called "Jogja") is the cultural heart of Java, a sultanate that has maintained its royal traditions even within the Indonesian republic. The current sultan still resides in the kraton (palace), and traditional arts—batik, gamelan, wayang puppetry—thrive here. The city also serves as the base for visiting Borobudur and Prambanan temples.

Long drive across Java, through volcanic highlands and endless rice terraces. Consider leaving early to arrive with time to explore. Yogyakarta's Jalan Malioboro is the main tourist strip, lined with batik shops and street food vendors. Evening at the kraton area, perhaps catching a traditional wayang kulit (shadow puppet) performance.

---

### Day 21: Borobudur Temple — *August 22, 2028*
**World's largest Buddhist temple**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 42 km each way |
| **Driving** | 1 hr each way |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Yogyakarta |

- Sunrise at Borobudur
- Explore the temple complex
- Mendut and Pawon temples

Borobudur is the world's largest Buddhist temple, a 9th-century masterpiece built by the Sailendra dynasty. The structure contains over 2,500 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues, arranged in nine stacked platforms that represent the Buddhist cosmological path to enlightenment. The temple was abandoned when Java's center shifted east and lay hidden under volcanic ash and jungle until rediscovered in 1814.

Pre-dawn departure for sunrise at Borobudur—watching the sun rise over the temple with volcanic peaks in the background is one of Indonesia's iconic experiences. Spend the morning exploring all nine levels, following the narrative reliefs that tell Buddhist stories. Visit the smaller Mendut and Pawon temples nearby before returning to Yogyakarta for afternoon batik shopping or a cooking class.

---

### Day 22: Prambanan Temple — *August 23, 2028*
**Hindu counterpart**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 18 km each way |
| **Driving** | 30 min each way |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Yogyakarta |

- Prambanan Temple complex
- Smaller temples nearby
- Evening Ramayana ballet (seasonal)

Prambanan is Borobudur's Hindu counterpart, built slightly later by the Sanjaya dynasty. The central compound contains three main temples dedicated to the Trimurti—Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma—with Shiva's 47-meter central spire dominating the complex. An earthquake in 2006 caused significant damage; ongoing restoration continues.

Morning at Prambanan, exploring the main complex and the surrounding smaller temples scattered across the archaeological park. The Ramayana relief panels on the main temples tell the Hindu epic in stone. If visiting during the dry season (May-October), the evening Ramayana Ballet performs the story with Prambanan as its dramatic backdrop—one of Java's premier cultural experiences.

---

### Day 23: Yogyakarta → Bromo — *August 24, 2028*
**Toward the volcanic heartland**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 350 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cemoro Lawang (2 nights) |

- Drive east across Java
- Climb to Bromo viewpoint
- Cemoro Lawang village

The road from Yogyakarta to Bromo climbs through ever-changing volcanic landscapes. Java contains over 100 volcanoes, of which around 35 are active. Mount Bromo is one of the most accessible and photographed—a smoking cone rising from the vast Tengger Sand Sea within the larger Tengger Caldera.

Steady drive eastward, the terrain becoming more dramatic as you approach the Tengger massif. The road climbs steeply to Cemoro Lawang, a small village perched on the caldera rim at 2,217 meters. Evening temperatures are refreshingly cool. First views of the caldera and Bromo's smoking cone from the village—tomorrow's sunrise will be spectacular.

---

### Day 24: Mount Bromo — *August 25, 2028*
**Sunrise over the sea of sand**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Bromo scenic route |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Cemoro Lawang |

- 3am: Drive to Penanjakan viewpoint
- Sunrise over Bromo
- Descend to Sand Sea
- Climb to crater rim
- Scenic drive through caldera

Mount Bromo at sunrise is one of Southeast Asia's most otherworldly experiences. The viewpoint at Penanjakan looks down on the Tengger Caldera—a vast sand sea with smoking Bromo in the center, backed by the massive cone of Mount Semeru, Java's highest peak and an active stratovolcano. The scene is prehistoric, alien, unforgettable.

Wake at 2:30am for the drive to Penanjakan. Arrive before the crowds to secure a good viewpoint. Watch the sky lighten, revealing the caldera's scale and Bromo's smoke plume catching the first rays. Descend to the Sand Sea and drive or walk across the volcanic ash to Bromo's base. Climb 250 steps to the crater rim, peering into the smoking vent. The Mount Bromo scenic route continues through the caldera—one of Indonesia's premier driving experiences.

---

### Day 25: Bromo → Banyuwangi → Bali — *August 26, 2028*
**Crossing to the Island of the Gods**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 280 km + ferry |
| **Driving** | 5 hrs |
| **Ferry** | Ketapang → Gilimanuk (30 min) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Pemuteran |

- Descend from highlands
- Drive to Banyuwangi
- Ferry to Bali
- North coast drive to Pemuteran

The short ferry crossing from Java to Bali takes just 30 minutes, but the cultural shift is profound. Java is predominantly Muslim; Bali remains Hindu, the last refuge of the religion that once dominated the Indonesian archipelago. Temple ceremonies, offerings on every doorstep, and the distinctive gamelan music mark your arrival in a different world.

Morning drive down from the Bromo highlands to the coast at Banyuwangi. The Ketapang-Gilimanuk ferry runs frequently; simply drive on and enjoy the short crossing of the Bali Strait. Instead of heading to the tourist-packed south, turn right along the quiet north coast road. Drive to Pemuteran, a laid-back village known for its coral restoration project and excellent diving—far from the Instagram crowds.

---

## Week 4-5: Bali (North Coast Route)

### Day 26: Pemuteran — *August 27, 2028*
**Underwater paradise**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Pemuteran |

- Snorkeling/diving Menjangan Island
- Biorock coral restoration
- Quiet beach time
- Village life

Pemuteran is the antithesis of south Bali—no traffic, no hawkers, just a quiet fishing village that happens to have some of Indonesia's best diving. The Biorock project here has created artificial reefs using low-voltage electricity to accelerate coral growth, turning damaged areas into thriving underwater gardens. Nearby Menjangan Island offers pristine wall diving.

Full day exploring Pemuteran's underwater world. Morning boat trip to Menjangan Island for snorkeling or diving—the walls drop 60 meters with pristine hard corals and schools of fish. Afternoon swimming over the Biorock structures just offshore, seeing coral restoration in action. Evening in the village, watching fishermen return with their catch, dining at simple warungs. This is the Bali tourists never see.

---

### Day 27: Pemuteran → Lovina → Singaraja — *August 28, 2028*
**The north coast road**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 50 km |
| **Driving** | 1.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Singaraja |

- Coastal drive east
- Lovina black sand beaches
- Singaraja Dutch colonial heritage
- Gedong Kirtya library

The north coast road is one of Bali's great drives—the sea on one side, volcanic mountains rising on the other. Singaraja was Bali's capital under Dutch rule until 1953, and retains a different atmosphere from the rest of the island. Colonial-era buildings line the streets, and the pace of life remains unhurried. The town was a major trading port, and its mixed heritage includes Chinese, Arab, and Bugis influences.

Leisurely coastal drive east through Lovina, a string of villages with black sand beaches and calm waters. Continue to Singaraja and explore its Dutch colonial quarter—the old harbor, Chinese temples, and the remarkable Gedong Kirtya library with its collection of ancient lontar palm-leaf manuscripts. This is Bali's intellectual heart, a world away from the beach clubs and rice terrace selfies.

---

### Day 28: Singaraja → Munduk — *August 29, 2028*
**Into the mountains**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 25 km |
| **Driving** | 1 hr |
| **Stay** | Guesthouse - Munduk |

- Mountain road ascent
- Coffee and clove plantations
- Munduk waterfalls
- Cool highland air

Munduk is a former Dutch hill station perched in Bali's central mountains at 800 meters elevation. The village is surrounded by coffee, clove, and cacao plantations, with waterfalls hidden in every valley. The temperature drops noticeably from the coast, and mist often hangs in the trees. This is Bali's agricultural heartland, where farmers still use traditional methods.

Wind up the mountain road from Singaraja, the scenery shifting from coastal scrub to lush tropical forest. Munduk appears through the mist—a village of simple homes and Dutch-era plantation buildings. Afternoon hiking to Munduk waterfall or the twin falls at Banyumala, walking through coffee groves and forest. Evening with a warm drink watching clouds roll through the valley.

---

### Day 29: Munduk → Canggu — *August 30, 2028*
**Descent to the coast**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 55 km |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Stay** | MM Villa - Canggu (2 nights) |

- Morning mountain walk
- Descent through rice terraces
- Arrive Canggu
- Settle into MM Villa

The road from Munduk to the south coast winds through some of Bali's most spectacular scenery—volcanic lakes, ancient temples, and terraced hillsides. Rather than stopping at every tourist checkpoint, drive straight through to Canggu and the comfort of MM Villa.

Final morning walk in Munduk's cool air, perhaps catching sunrise over the valley. Then descend south, passing Lake Buyan and Lake Tamblingan in their volcanic calderas. The road drops through Bedugul and its botanical gardens, then winds down to the coastal plain. Arrive at MM Villa in Canggu—the perfect base to decompress after days of exploration.

A rest day in Canggu, based at MM Villa. The padel clubs nearby offer a chance to play the sport that's sweeping Bali's expat scene. Otherwise, simply enjoy the villa's pool, the nearby beaches, and the excellent restaurants and cafes.

Sleep in, enjoy MM Villa's facilities, perhaps morning surf at Echo Beach or Batu Bolong. Afternoon options include padel at one of Canggu's excellent clubs, yoga sessions, spa treatments, or simply poolside relaxation. Sunset drinks at a beach club, dinner at one of Canggu's many excellent restaurants. A day to recharge before continuing east.

### Day 31: Canggu → Amed — *September 1, 2028*
**East coast**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 95 km |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Amed (2 nights) |

- Cross to east Bali
- Coastal road
- Amed fishing villages
- Afternoon snorkeling

East Bali remains refreshingly undeveloped. The coast around Amed is a string of fishing villages with simple accommodation, traditional salt-making, and extraordinary underwater life. The Japanese shipwreck from WWII lies just offshore, accessible to snorkelers. Mount Agung looms overhead, and the sunrises here are legendary.

Drive east across Bali, bypassing the southern tourist zones entirely. The road hugs the coast as development fades away, replaced by fishing communities and coconut groves. Arrive in Amed by early afternoon, leaving time for snorkeling over coral gardens and the famous Liberty shipwreck. Evening watching fishermen bring in their catch, dining on the freshest seafood.

---

### Day 32: Amed — *September 2, 2028*
**Underwater and mountaineering**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Amed |

- Snorkeling or diving
- Traditional salt making
- Mount Agung views
- Sunset from Jemeluk Bay

Amed's waters are famous for healthy coral, abundant fish, and several shipwrecks. The Japanese wreck just offshore is accessible by snorkel, while divers can explore deeper sites. On land, traditional salt-making continues as it has for centuries—seawater evaporated in hollowed palm logs. Mount Agung, Bali's highest and holiest volcano, dominates the skyline.

Morning snorkeling or diving at the area's best sites—the clarity here rivals anywhere in Indonesia. Watch the traditional salt farmers at work, their methods unchanged for generations. Afternoon free for beach time, more snorkeling, or simply contemplating Mount Agung. If the mountain is open for climbing (check volcanic status), the pre-dawn trek offers sunrise from Bali's sacred summit.

---

### Day 33: Amed → Padang Bai — *September 3, 2028*
**Preparing for island hopping**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 60 km |
| **Driving** | 1.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Padang Bai |

- Coastal drive south
- Tirta Gangga water palace
- Padang Bai port town

Padang Bai is the main ferry port for connections to Lombok and the islands beyond. The small town has a traveler vibe, with backpacker cafes and dive shops serving those waiting for ferries or exploring the east coast. Several small beaches around the headlands offer good snorkeling.

Scenic coastal drive south, stopping at Tirta Gangga—the "Water of the Ganges" palace built by the last raja of Karangasem. The water gardens with their stepping stones and koi pools are wonderfully peaceful. Continue to Padang Bai, checking ferry schedules for tomorrow's crossing to Lombok. Evening in the port town, easy restaurants and final Bali sunset.

---

## Week 5-6: Island Hopping to Timor

### Day 34: Padang Bai → Lombok — *September 4, 2028*
**First island hop**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferry crossing |
| **Ferry** | Padang Bai → Lembar (4-5 hrs) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Senggigi/Mataram |

- Morning ferry to Lombok
- Sasak culture begins
- West Lombok coast

Lombok sits in a transition zone between Asian and Australian biological realms—the Wallace Line passes through here. The island's Sasak people are predominantly Muslim, in contrast to Hindu Bali just visible to the west. Mount Rinjani, Indonesia's second-highest volcano, dominates the north.

Morning departure on the car ferry to Lembar, Lombok's main port. The crossing takes 4-5 hours—time to relax on deck with views of Mount Agung receding and Mount Rinjani appearing. Arrive early afternoon and drive north to Senggigi or Mataram. The shift from Bali to Lombok is subtle but noticeable—mosques instead of temples, different architecture, a quieter pace.

---

### Day 35: Lombok — *September 5, 2028*
**Sasak villages and vistas**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 80 km |
| **Driving** | 2 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Senggigi |

- Traditional Sasak villages
- Pottery and weaving crafts
- Mount Rinjani views
- Gili Islands viewpoint

The Sasak are Lombok's indigenous people, their traditional villages built from bamboo and thatch with distinctive peaked rice barns. The village of Sade is one of the most accessible, though increasingly touristy. Sasak crafts include distinctive pottery and ikat weaving.

Day exploring Lombok's cultural heartland. Visit Sade or Rambitan traditional villages to see Sasak architecture and lifestyle. Stop at pottery villages to watch the distinctive technique of shaping clay by hand. Afternoon drive toward the Gili Islands viewpoint for sunset vistas over the three small islands that have become Lombok's main tourist drawcard. (The Gilis are pedestrian/bicycle only—no cars—so we skip them on this driving expedition.)

---

### Day 36: Lombok → Sumbawa — *September 6, 2028*
**Deeper into Nusa Tenggara**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 100 km + ferry |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Ferry** | Kayangan → Poto Tano (2 hrs) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Sumbawa Besar |

- Cross Lombok eastward
- Ferry to Sumbawa
- Remote island begins

Sumbawa is twice the size of Lombok but far less developed. The island bridges the geological and cultural transition from Asian to Australian influence, with landscapes becoming drier and more rugged. Tourism is minimal—those who cross do so to reach Komodo and Flores.

Drive across Lombok to Kayangan ferry port on the east coast. The ferry to Poto Tano runs regularly, taking about two hours across the Alas Strait. Arrive on Sumbawa and drive to Sumbawa Besar, the main town. Infrastructure is basic; this is overlanding territory now. The landscape is drier, more African in character, with fewer rice paddies and more savanna.

---

### Day 37: Sumbawa → Bima — *September 7, 2028*
**Crossing the wild island**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 250 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bima |

- Trans-Sumbawa Highway
- Decreasing development
- Bima sultanate remnants

The Trans-Sumbawa Highway runs the length of this elongated island, through landscapes that grow increasingly remote and rugged. Bima at the eastern end was once a powerful sultanate; the former palace museum preserves some of that heritage.

Long driving day across Sumbawa's heartland. The road is generally good but winding through mountainous terrain. Few tourist stops—this is pure transit territory, the price of overlanding to Flores. Arrive Bima with time to explore the small town and old sultanate palace. Tomorrow: the Sape ferry to Labuan Bajo and Komodo.

---

### Day 38: Bima → Labuan Bajo — *September 8, 2028*
**Gateway to Komodo**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 100 km + ferry |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Ferry** | Sape → Labuan Bajo (7 hrs) |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Labuan Bajo (3 nights) |

- Morning drive to Sape port
- Day ferry crossing
- Arrive Flores

The Sape to Labuan Bajo ferry crosses the Sape Strait, passing between Komodo and Rinca Islands where the famous dragons live. The 7-hour journey offers views of these volcanic islands rising from the sea. Labuan Bajo has transformed from fishing village to tourist gateway, with hotels and dive operations catering to Komodo visitors.

Early arrival at Sape port—ferry typically departs at 9am. The day-long crossing passes through Komodo National Park waters, with possible views of the islands where dragons rule. Dolphins often accompany the ferry. Arrive Labuan Bajo in the afternoon, checking into a hotel with views over the island-studded harbor. Tomorrow: meeting the Komodo dragons.

---

### Day 39: Komodo National Park — *September 9, 2028*
**Dragons and diving**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Boat tour |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Labuan Bajo |

- Full-day boat tour
- Komodo Island: dragons
- Pink Beach
- Snorkeling at Manta Point

Komodo dragons are the world's largest lizards, growing up to 3 meters long and weighing up to 70 kg. These apex predators survive only on a few islands in this national park, having evolved their size in isolation over millions of years. Their venomous bite and patient hunting strategy make them formidable predators.

Full-day boat tour into Komodo National Park. First stop: Komodo or Rinca Island for a ranger-guided trek to see the dragons in their natural habitat. They're surprisingly fast when motivated—rangers carry forked sticks for safety. Continue to Pink Beach (one of only seven in the world) for swimming and snorkeling. Afternoon at Manta Point with high probability of encountering manta rays gliding through the current.

---

### Day 40: Labuan Bajo — *September 10, 2028*
**Flores exploration begins**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Labuan Bajo |

- Rest morning
- Explore Labuan Bajo
- Sunset at Puncak Waringin
- Plan overland route

Labuan Bajo has developed rapidly but retains rough edges—a frontier town feeling with fishing boats sharing the harbor with tourist speedboats. The sunset point at Puncak Waringin offers panoramic views over the island-scattered bay. The town also serves as the starting point for the overland journey across Flores.

Rest morning after yesterday's boat adventure. Explore the town—fish market, harbor, local cafes. Afternoon hike to the Waringin sunset viewpoint for panoramic views over the islands. Evening planning the route across Flores, one of Indonesia's most scenic drives. The Trans-Flores Highway threads through volcanic landscapes, traditional villages, and past the extraordinary colored lakes of Kelimutu.

---

### Day 41: Labuan Bajo → Ruteng — *September 11, 2028*
**Into Flores**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 140 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Ruteng |

- Winding mountain roads
- Manggarai highlands
- Spider-web rice fields
- Cool mountain town

Flores means "flowers" in Portuguese—the name given by 16th-century traders. The Trans-Flores Highway is one of Indonesia's great drives, winding through dramatically diverse landscapes. The western highlands around Ruteng are cool and lush, home to the Manggarai people famous for their unique spider-web shaped rice fields.

Challenging but spectacular driving as the road climbs from coastal Labuan Bajo into the Manggarai highlands. The winding route passes through traditional villages and forest. Near Ruteng, stop at the Lingko rice fields—circular terraces divided like spider webs, each segment belonging to a different family. Ruteng itself is a pleasant mountain town with cool evenings and traditional markets.

---

### Day 42: Ruteng → Bajawa — *September 12, 2028*
**Ngada traditional culture**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 125 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bajawa (2 nights) |

- Continue Trans-Flores
- Enter Ngada territory
- Traditional Bena village

The Ngada people occupy the central highlands of Flores, their traditional villages among the most intact in Indonesia. Megalithic structures, tall peaked houses, and elaborate ancestor shrines create distinctive village layouts. The Ngada practice a blend of Catholicism and ancestral beliefs that coexist without contradiction.

Winding drive through increasingly dramatic volcanic landscape. Descend to Bajawa, a market town at 1,100 meters serving as the base for visiting Ngada villages. Afternoon visit to Bena, one of the most impressive traditional villages—the stone megaliths and ancestor shrines date back generations, while villagers continue daily life in their high-peaked houses. Incredible photographic opportunities.

---

### Day 43: Bajawa & Villages — *September 13, 2028*
**Megaliths and hot springs**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Bajawa |

- Traditional village visits
- Hot springs at Soa
- Volcano views
- Local markets

The Ngada villages around Bajawa vary in character but share the striking vertical houses and megalithic stonework. Wogo and Luba are less touristed than Bena but equally fascinating. Natural hot springs at Soa provide a chance to soak while gazing at volcanic peaks.

Full day exploring Ngada territory. Visit additional villages—each has different megaliths and stories. Guides from the villages themselves can explain the complex belief system and clan structures. Afternoon soak in the hot springs at Soa, geothermal water heated by the volcanic system beneath. Return to Bajawa via the evening market, watching locals gather for trade and gossip.

---

### Day 44: Bajawa → Moni — *September 14, 2028*
**Toward Kelimutu**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 210 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Stay** | Guesthouse - Moni |

- Trans-Flores continues
- Ende detour option
- Climb to Moni village

Moni is a small village at the base of Mount Kelimutu, famous for its three crater lakes that display different colors. The geological phenomenon occurs because each lake has different mineral content and different levels of volcanic gas activity—the colors change unpredictably over time.

Long but rewarding drive across the Flores highlands. Optional detour through Ende, the island's largest town and independence hero Sukarno's place of exile. The road climbs to Moni, a collection of simple guesthouses at 1,500 meters catering to Kelimutu visitors. Early dinner and early bed—the sunrise trek begins before dawn.

---

### Day 45: Kelimutu — *September 15, 2028*
**Three-colored lakes**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 15 km to crater + 150 km to Maumere |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Maumere |

- Pre-dawn drive to summit
- Sunrise over crater lakes
- Continue to Maumere

Kelimutu's three lakes currently display turquoise, black-brown, and pale blue-green—but these colors change over months and years. The westernmost lake ("Lake of Old People") is typically darker, while the two eastern lakes ("Lake of Young Men and Maidens" and "Bewitched Lake") show more varied colors. Local belief holds that souls of the dead migrate to these lakes.

Depart at 4am for the 13 km drive to the parking area, then climb the remaining 30 minutes to the summit. Watch the sunrise reveal the three differently-colored lakes—an otherworldly sight unique on Earth. Spend time exploring the crater rim as mists rise from the lakes. Descend to Moni for breakfast, then continue to Maumere on the north coast, Flores' largest town and end of the Trans-Flores highway.

---

### Day 46: Maumere → Larantuka — *September 16, 2028*
**Eastern tip of Flores**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 140 km |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Larantuka |

- Coast road east
- Portuguese heritage
- Ferry port for Timor

Larantuka at the eastern tip of Flores is the main ferry port for connections to West Timor. The town has strong Portuguese heritage—Dominican missionaries established themselves here in the 1500s, and distinctive Easter processions continue traditions centuries old. The old Portuguese fort is gone, but churches and traditions remain.

Morning drive along Flores' north coast, through small Catholic villages with whitewashed churches—the Portuguese influence visible everywhere. Arrive Larantuka with time to explore the town and its Portuguese-era churches. Check ferry schedules for tomorrow's crossing to Kupang, West Timor. The ferry runs twice weekly, so timing is crucial.

---

### Day 47: Larantuka → Kupang — *September 17, 2028*
**Crossing to Timor**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferry (15+ hrs) |
| **Ferry** | Larantuka → Kupang (overnight) |
| **Stay** | On ferry / Hotel - Kupang |

- Board ferry
- Overnight crossing
- Arrive West Timor

The ferry from Larantuka to Kupang crosses the Savu Sea, passing islands and making the transition from Flores to Timor. The overnight journey takes approximately 15 hours, with basic cabin options available. Kupang serves as the capital of East Nusa Tenggara Province and the gateway to Timor-Leste.

Afternoon boarding of the ferry at Larantuka. The vessel carries vehicles and passengers, with deck space for those not booking cabins. The overnight crossing passes volcanic islands in the darkness. Arrive Kupang the following morning, clearing port formalities and driving into the city. Kupang is a transit point rather than a destination—basic supplies and rest before continuing to Timor-Leste.

---

## Week 6-7: Timor-Leste

### Day 48: Kupang → Dili — *September 18, 2028*
**Crossing into the newest nation**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 290 km |
| **Driving** | 6 hrs |
| **Border** | Atambua/Batugade |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Dili (2 nights) |

- Drive across West Timor
- International border crossing
- Enter Timor-Leste
- Capital city

Timor-Leste (East Timor) is one of the world's youngest nations, having gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 after decades of occupation and a violent separation. The country remains one of Asia's least visited, with minimal tourist infrastructure but genuine hospitality and haunting beauty. Portuguese colonial heritage blends with Indonesian and indigenous Timorese elements.

Drive across West Timor to the international border at Atambua/Batugade. Border formalities can take time—ensure you have a Timor-Leste visa (available on arrival for most nationalities) and vehicle import permits arranged. The road quality changes noticeably after crossing. Arrive Dili, the small capital city with its beachfront promenade, Portuguese architecture, and memorial sites from the struggle for independence.

---

### Day 49: Dili — *September 19, 2028*
**Understanding Timor-Leste**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stay** | Hotel - Dili |

- Cristo Rei statue
- Resistance Museum
- Tais Market
- Beach promenade

Dili bears the scars and symbols of Timor-Leste's tumultuous history. The Cristo Rei statue, the second-largest in the world after Brazil's, stands above the city as a symbol of Catholic identity. The Resistance Museum documents the 24-year struggle against Indonesian occupation that killed an estimated 100,000-180,000 Timorese.

Morning climb or drive to Cristo Rei for panoramic views over Dili and the bay. Visit the Resistance Museum to understand the recent history that shaped this nation. Afternoon at the Tais Market, where traditional handwoven textiles display the intricate patterns of Timor's various ethnic groups. Evening walk along the waterfront, watching the sun set over this small, resilient capital.

---

### Day 50: Dili → Mount Ramelau — *September 20, 2028*
**Climbing the nation's highest peak**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 125 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Basic accommodation - Hato Builico |

- Mountain roads
- Base village of Hato Builico
- Prepare for pre-dawn ascent

Mount Ramelau (Tatamailau) rises 2,963 meters—the highest point in Timor-Leste. The summit holds a statue of the Virgin Mary and serves as a pilgrimage site. The traditional trek begins before dawn to reach the summit for sunrise; on clear days, views extend to both the north and south coasts.

Challenging drive into the mountains—road quality deteriorates significantly. The village of Hato Builico serves as the base, with very basic accommodation (or camping). Simple dinner and early sleep for the 3am departure tomorrow. The altitude means cool temperatures—bring warm layers for the climb.

---

### Day 51: Mount Ramelau → Dili — *September 21, 2028*
**Summit and return**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 125 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Dili |

- Pre-dawn trek (2-3 hrs up)
- Sunrise at summit
- Return to Dili

The pre-dawn climb follows a well-worn pilgrimage path through eucalyptus forests to the bare summit. Local guides can be arranged in Hato Builico. The final section involves some scrambling, but no technical skills are required. Dawn from the summit reveals both coasts of Timor—a fitting view of this divided island.

Wake at 3am for the summit attempt. Headlamps light the path through forests and along ridges. Reach the summit before dawn, praying with any Timorese pilgrims present, then watching the sun rise over the sea. Descend more quickly in daylight, returning to the vehicle for the drive back to Dili. Hot shower and comfortable bed after two days in the mountains.

---

### Day 52: Atauro Island — *September 22, 2028*
**World's best reef diversity**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferry (2 hrs each way) |
| **Stay** | Eco-lodge - Atauro |

- Morning ferry to Atauro
- Snorkeling/diving
- Island village exploration

Atauro Island, 25 km north of Dili, holds the world record for reef fish diversity—a single dive site recorded 642 species. The island was off-limits during Indonesian occupation and remains relatively pristine. Simple eco-lodges and village stays offer authentic immersion in island life.

Morning ferry from Dili to Atauro (about 2 hours). The crossing passes over clear waters where dolphins are common. Arrive at the main village and settle into an eco-lodge—expect basic but comfortable accommodation. Afternoon snorkeling on the extraordinary reefs—the clarity and abundance of life surpass almost anywhere else. Evening in the village, sharing dinner with local families.

---

### Day 53: Atauro → Dili → Shipping — *September 23, 2028*
**Preparing for Australia**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Ferry to Dili |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Dili |

- Morning on Atauro
- Return to Dili
- Arrange vehicle shipping
- Explore remaining Dili

The vehicle shipping from Dili to Darwin requires advance coordination with shipping agents—Bollore/SDV, Perkins/Toll, or Crossland are the main operators. The service runs approximately every 10 days to monthly, with a 2-day voyage. Expect to be separated from your vehicle for 7-13 days total including port processing.

Final morning on Atauro—snorkel or simply enjoy the island peace. Return ferry to Dili and begin the shipping process. Meet with shipping agents to confirm booking and understand customs requirements. Australian quarantine is extremely strict—the vehicle must be thoroughly cleaned of any mud, seeds, or plant material. Prepare for the flight to Darwin and temporary separation from the Land Cruiser.
