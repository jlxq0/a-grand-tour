# Detailed Itinerary

## Week 1: Golden Triangle & Rajasthan Start

### Day 1: Delhi — *September 1, 2027*
**Pick up vehicle, Golden Triangle begins**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Delhi |

We're back in India after a three-month break at home, and what better way to start Trip 2 than with the legendary Golden Triangle? Delhi is our launch pad—a chaotic, overwhelming, beautiful mess of a city where ancient Mughal tombs sit next to gleaming metro stations and street food vendors serve the best parathas you'll ever taste. Today is about reuniting with our Land Cruiser and making sure everything still works after months in storage. *Weather: Hot and humid, monsoon tail-end—expect 32°C with possible afternoon showers.*

- Pick up car from storage
- Vehicle inspection after 3-month break
- Evening: Prepare for early start

---

### Day 2: Delhi → Agra — *September 2, 2027*
**Taj Mahal**

![Taj Mahal](data/pois/images/in/taj-mahal-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 207 km |
| **Driving** | 3 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Agra (2 nights) |

The Yamuna Expressway makes quick work of what used to be a grueling journey, and by early afternoon we're in Agra—home to what many consider the most beautiful building ever created by human hands. The Taj Mahal needs no introduction: Shah Jahan's monument to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal is the ultimate expression of love in white marble. We time our first visit for late afternoon when the crowds thin and the setting sun paints the marble in shades of gold and pink. *Weather: Still monsoon-humid at 31°C, but the Taj looks ethereal through the hazy air.*

- Yamuna Expressway to Agra
- Afternoon: Taj Mahal sunset viewing
- Evening: Rooftop dinner with Taj views

---

### Day 3: Agra — *September 3, 2027*
**Rest day - Mughal heritage**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Agra |

We return to the Taj at dawn—the only way to truly experience it. Arriving at 5:30am means beating most tour groups and watching the first light of day slowly illuminate the marble as mist rises from the Yamuna River. It's utterly magical. The rest of the day is dedicated to Agra's other Mughal treasures: the imposing red sandstone Agra Fort where Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his own son, and the exquisite Itimad-ud-Daulah (the "Baby Taj"), which actually predates and inspired its more famous neighbor. *Weather: Early morning mist burns off to another warm 30°C day—perfect for the sunrise Taj visit.*

- Sunrise: Taj Mahal (arrive 5:30am!)
- Agra Fort
- Baby Taj (Itimad-ud-Daulah)
- Evening: Mehtab Bagh river view

---

### Day 4: Agra → Jaipur — *September 4, 2027*
**Pink City**

![Hawa Mahal](data/pois/images/in/hawa-mahal-jaipur-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 246 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jaipur (2 nights) |

Completing the Golden Triangle, we head west to Rajasthan—land of maharajas, desert fortresses, and some of the most colorful culture in India. En route, we stop at Fatehpur Sikri, the eerily beautiful ghost city that Emperor Akbar built as his capital only to abandon it 14 years later due to water scarcity. Jaipur welcomes us with its signature pink-painted old city walls, commissioned in 1876 to welcome Prince Albert. The iconic Hawa Mahal—with its 953 tiny windows designed so royal women could observe street life without being seen—is particularly stunning when illuminated at night. *Weather: Entering Rajasthan means drier air at 33°C—monsoon is retreating and desert heat takes over.*

- Stop: Fatehpur Sikri (Mughal ghost city)
- Afternoon: Arrive Jaipur
- Evening: Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds) lit up

---

### Day 5: Jaipur — *September 5, 2027*
**Rest day - Pink City exploration**

![Amber Fort](data/pois/images/in/amber-fort-jaipur-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | Day trip to Amber Fort |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jaipur |

A full day to explore Jaipur's treasures, starting with the crown jewel: Amber Fort. This magnificent hilltop fortress of red sandstone and marble overlooks Maota Lake and took over 100 years to build. The Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors) inside is jaw-dropping—thousands of tiny mirrors that would illuminate the room with just two candles. Back in the city, we visit the City Palace where the royal family still resides, and the Jantar Mantar—an 18th-century astronomical observation site with giant sundials that are still accurate to within seconds. *Weather: Hot but manageable at 32°C with low humidity—Rajasthan's dry heat is easier to bear than Delhi's monsoon mugginess.*

- Morning: Amber Fort (arrive early, beat heat)
- City Palace, Jantar Mantar observatory
- Evening: Bazaar shopping, rooftop dinner

---

### Day 6: Jaipur → Jodhpur — *September 6, 2027*
**Blue City**

![Mehrangarh Fort](data/pois/images/in/mehrangarh-fort-jodhpur-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 333 km |
| **Driving** | 5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jodhpur (2 nights) |

Deeper into Rajasthan now, the landscape becomes more arid and the towns more distinctly desert-like. Jodhpur announces itself dramatically: a sea of blue-painted houses clustered beneath one of India's most formidable forts. The blue color, originally used by Brahmins to identify their homes, was adopted by the rest of the city and now gives Jodhpur its famous "Blue City" nickname. Mehrangarh Fort rises 125 meters above the city on a sheer cliff—many consider it the finest fort in all of India, and standing at its ramparts watching the blue city glow in the setting sun, it's hard to argue. *Weather: Desert climate kicks in—expect 34°C during the day but pleasant evenings around 24°C, perfect for rooftop dinners.*

- Drive through Rajasthan countryside
- Afternoon: Mehrangarh Fort (best fort in India!)
- Evening: Blue city views at sunset

---

### Day 7: Jodhpur — *September 7, 2027*
**Rest day - Blue City immersion**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | 0 km |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Jodhpur |

A day to get lost in the blue. We start at Mehrangarh Fort's excellent museum, which houses an incredible collection of royal palanquins, elephant howdahs, and Mughal miniature paintings. Then we pay respects at Jaswant Thada, a serene white marble memorial built like a miniature Taj, before descending into the narrow labyrinth of the old city. Here, every turn reveals another impossibly blue wall, another hidden temple, another chai stall where locals invite you to sit and chat. The clock tower market at dusk is sensory overload in the best way—spices piled high in pyramids of red and orange, textiles draped from every stall, and the smell of mirchi vada frying for evening snacks. *Weather: Similar to yesterday at 34°C—start early to beat the afternoon heat, rest midday, then explore again as it cools.*

- Mehrangarh Fort museum
- Jaswant Thada marble memorial
- Old city walk through blue streets
- Evening: Clock tower market

---

## Week 2: Desert & Lakes

### Day 8: Jodhpur → Jaisalmer — *September 8, 2027*
**Golden City**

![Jaisalmer Fort](data/pois/images/in/jaisalmer-fort-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 279 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel inside Fort - Jaisalmer (2 nights) |

- Desert drive, getting remote
- Afternoon: Arrive Jaisalmer - only "living fort" in India
- Stay inside 850-year-old fort walls

Jaisalmer is India's most remote major city, an outpost on the edge of the Thar Desert just 100km from the Pakistan border. Founded in 1156, the city prospered from caravan trade until the Partition of India in 1947 severed these routes. Jaisalmer Fort is unique among Indian forts - a "living fort" where one-quarter of the old city's population (about 3,000 people) still lives within its 12th-century walls. The entire city appears golden due to the yellow sandstone from which it's built.

Drive west from Jodhpur through increasingly arid landscape - the last section passes through genuine desert. Arrive Jaisalmer mid-afternoon as the low sun makes the sandstone walls glow gold. Accommodation inside the fort itself offers a unique experience of staying within medieval walls. Evening walk through the narrow fort lanes to the ramparts for sunset. Early September temperatures: 34-36°C during the day, cooling to 26°C at night.

---

### Day 9: Jaisalmer — *September 9, 2027*
**Rest day - Desert experience**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | Desert excursion |
| **Stay** | Desert camp / Return to fort hotel |

- Morning: Fort exploration, havelis
- Afternoon: Camel safari into Sam Sand Dunes
- Sunset: Desert dunes, traditional dinner
- Option: Night in desert camp or return to fort

Jaisalmer's havelis (mansions) are among India's finest examples of sandstone carving. Built by wealthy merchants in the 18th-19th centuries, these buildings feature incredibly intricate facades with hundreds of carved balconies, screens, and ornamental details. Patwon Ki Haveli, the largest, took 55 years to complete. The Sam Sand Dunes, 42km west of Jaisalmer, offer the classic Thar Desert experience with rolling golden dunes reaching heights of 30-60 meters.

Morning exploring the fort and its Jain temples, then visiting the famous havelis in the lower town - Patwon Ki Haveli and Nathmal Ki Haveli are highlights. Afternoon camel safari departing for the Sam Sand Dunes, timed to arrive for sunset over the dunes. Option to stay overnight at a desert camp or return to the fort hotel. Early September temperatures in the desert: 35-38°C during the day; nights in the desert can drop to 22°C.

---

### Day 10: Jaisalmer → Udaipur — *September 10, 2027*

Udaipur was founded in 1559 by Maharana Udai Singh II after Akbar conquered the previous Mewar capital of Chittorgarh. The city is built around artificial lakes and is known as the "Venice of the East." The Ranakpur Jain Temples, en route from Jaisalmer, feature 1,444 intricately carved marble pillars - no two alike. Udaipur's City Palace is the largest palace complex in Rajasthan, stretching 244 meters along Lake Pichola.

Long driving day across Rajasthan. Break the journey at Ranakpur for the extraordinary Jain temples - allow at least an hour to appreciate the carved marble. Arrive Udaipur late afternoon for sunset over Lake Pichola. The lakeside setting is immediately captivating. Mid-September temperatures: 28-32°C with monsoon moisture still present - occasional rain adds to the lake's beauty.

- City Palace
- Boat ride to Jag Mandir island
- Bagore Ki Haveli evening show

Udaipur's City Palace took 400 years to complete, with successive maharanas adding their own contributions. The palace is now partly a museum and partly the Taj Lake Palace hotel. Lake Pichola was enlarged by Maharana Udai Singh II to create a water supply for the city; two island palaces - Jag Mandir and Jag Niwas (the Lake Palace) - were built within it. The octopus scene from the James Bond film Octopussy was filmed at Jag Mandir.

Full day exploring Udaipur. Morning at the City Palace complex - allow 2-3 hours for the museums and courtyards. Afternoon boat ride across Lake Pichola with a stop at Jag Mandir island.

- Cross into Gujarat
- Arrive evening at white salt desert
- Sunset over endless white expanse

The Rann of Kutch is the world's largest salt marsh, covering 7,500 square kilometers on the India-Pakistan border. During the monsoon (June-September), the Rann floods; as the water evaporates through October-February, a perfectly flat white salt desert emerges. The Kutch region is home to distinct tribal communities - the Rabari, Ahir, and Jat - known for their embroidery, mirror work, and traditional mud houses. A special permit is required to visit some areas near the border.

Very long driving day west from Udaipur into Gujarat. Cross the Aravalli Hills and descend into the flatlands leading to the Rann. Arrival timed for sunset over the salt flats - the white expanse stretching to the horizon is surreal. Stay at one of the tent resorts on the edge of the Rann. Mid-September: the monsoon water may still partially cover the Rann; by late September the white salt emerges. Temperatures: 30-34°C.

The region's crafts are protected as Geographical Indications - Kutchi embroidery, Rogan art (painting with castor oil), and bandhani tie-dye are world-renowned.

Early morning walk onto the salt flats for sunrise - the white expanse changes color dramatically with the light. Midday visit to a Kutchi village to see traditional crafts being made; Hodka is particularly welcoming to visitors. Late afternoon return to the Rann for sunset.

The old city's pols (residential neighborhoods) contain wooden houses with exquisite carved facades. Sabarmati Ashram was Mahatma Gandhi's headquarters from 1917-1930 and the starting point of the Salt March. The Adalaj Stepwell (1498) is one of India's finest examples of this uniquely Gujarati architectural form.

Mumbai is India's financial capital and most populous city, with over 20 million people in the metropolitan area. The city grew from seven islands that the British merged through land reclamation in the 18th-19th centuries. The Gateway of India (1924) was built to commemorate King George V's visit and later became the symbolic point from which the last British troops departed in 1948. Marine Drive's Art Deco buildings along the Arabian Sea form one of the world's largest collections of the style.

| **Stay** | Beach resort - North Goa (3 nights) |

- Coastal highway south
- Konkan coast scenery
- Evening: Baga Beach sunset

Goa was a Portuguese colony for 450 years (1510-1961), far longer than British rule elsewhere in India. This history gives Goa a unique character: whitewashed churches, Portuguese architecture, and a more relaxed attitude to alcohol and beef. The Konkan coast between Mumbai and Goa is one of India's most scenic drives, with the Western Ghats mountains on one side and the Arabian Sea on the other. Goa has long been a beach destination, from the hippie trails of the 1960s to modern resort tourism.

Long driving day south on NH66 along the Konkan coast. The road winds through the Western Ghats with views of sea and mountains. Cross into Goa in late afternoon. Evening arrival at a beach resort in North Goa - Baga, Calangute, or Candolim area. First Goan sunset on the beach.

Anjuna's Wednesday flea market has been running since the hippie era. Palolem Beach in South Goa is a crescent-shaped bay considered one of India's most beautiful beaches, with a more relaxed atmosphere than the busy north.

Day 18: Morning visit to Old Goa's churches - the Basilica and Se Cathedral are essential; allow 2-3 hours. Afternoon at Anjuna if it's Wednesday (flea market), otherwise beach time. Day 19: Day trip to South Goa beaches - Palolem and Agonda offer a quieter experience than the north. Both evenings devoted to Goan seafood and sunsets.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site covers 26 square kilometers and contains over 1,600 ruins.

Drive inland from Goa through the Western Ghats into the Karnataka plateau. The landscape changes dramatically as the boulders of Hampi come into view.

Sanapur Lake, across the river from the main ruins, has become popular for cliff jumping and coracle (round boat) rides among the boulders.

Full day exploring Hampi's ruins. Morning at Vittala Temple - arrive early before tour groups; the stone chariot and musical pillars are unmissable. Midday at the Royal Enclosure and Lotus Mahal.

| **Stay** | Hotel - Bangalore |

- Drive through Karnataka
- Afternoon: Bangalore Palace
- Evening: MG Road, craft beer scene

Bangalore (officially Bengaluru) is India's tech capital, home to global companies and a thriving startup scene. The city sits at 900m elevation, giving it a more temperate climate than most of India. Bangalore Palace (1887) was built in Tudor Revival style by the local maharaja after a visit to Windsor Castle. The city's modern culture includes a craft beer scene that's among India's best - microbreweries line the streets around Koramangala and Indiranagar.

Drive southeast through Karnataka to Bangalore. The highway is good and the landscape transitions from rocky Deccan plateau to more forested terrain around the city. Arrive mid-afternoon. Visit Bangalore Palace, then explore the central business district around MG Road. Evening at one of the city's craft breweries - Toit and Arbor are local favorites. Late September temperatures pleasant: 22-28°C - Bangalore's altitude makes it cooler than the coast.

- Evening: Fort Kochi colonial area
- Chinese fishing nets at sunset

Kochi (Cochin) has been a trading port for over 600 years, attracting Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonizers. Fort Kochi is a peninsula that still contains Portuguese churches, Dutch mansions, and the iconic Chinese fishing nets (cheena vala) introduced by traders from the court of Kublai Khan. The Jewish community established here in the 16th century built what is now India's oldest active synagogue. The spice trade made Kochi wealthy; the famous Mattancherry spice market continues to operate today.

Long driving day descending from Bangalore through the Western Ghats into Kerala. The road is good but winding in places. Arrive Fort Kochi late afternoon.

Kathakali is Kerala's classical dance-drama form, featuring elaborate makeup that takes hours to apply and highly stylized storytelling through gesture.

Full day exploring Fort Kochi and Mattancherry. Morning walk to the Jewish synagogue and spice market - the area is compact and best explored on foot. Afternoon at the Dutch Palace for the murals. Evening Kathakali performance - most shows include a makeup demonstration beforehand. Finish with seafood dinner at one of the waterfront restaurants. September temperatures: 28-32°C.

- Wind through mountains to hill station
- Endless tea plantations
- Cool temperatures, misty mornings

Munnar sits at 1,600m in the Western Ghats, surrounded by some of India's highest tea plantations. The town developed in the late 19th century when the British established tea estates in this remote region. The name comes from "moonu aar" (three rivers) - the Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala rivers meet here. The landscape is carpeted in manicured tea bushes extending across rolling hills as far as the eye can see.

Scenic drive from sea level to the hills, climbing through spice gardens (cardamom, pepper) into the tea belt. The road winds through 35 hairpin bends; the views improve with every turn. Arrive Munnar mid-afternoon. The temperature drop is immediate and welcome - a relief from coastal heat. Evening walk through the tea plantations as mist rolls in. Late September temperatures: 15-22°C; bring layers for cool mornings.

The backwaters support a unique ecosystem of villages, coir (coconut fiber) production, and toddy (palm wine) tapping.

Descend from Munnar through the spice forests and rubber plantations to the coastal lowlands. Arrive Alleppey (Alappuzha) midday and board a kettuvallam houseboat. Spend the afternoon gliding through narrow canals lined with coconut palms, passing village life along the waterway. The houseboat crew prepares traditional Kerala meals.

- Best preserved medieval city in Nepal

- Potter's Square, traditional crafts

Bhaktapur is the best-preserved medieval city in Nepal, largely untouched by modern development due to its distance from Kathmandu's center.

Potter's Square has been producing traditional pottery for centuries using the same techniques. The entry fee keeps tourist numbers manageable.

Short morning drive to Bhaktapur. The city rewards slow exploration - spend the day wandering the medieval lanes, visiting the three durbar squares, and watching craftsmen at work in Potter's Square. The Nyatapola Temple survived the 2015 earthquake largely intact. Overnight in a heritage hotel within the old city - the evening atmosphere after day-trippers leave is magical.

The lakeside tourist area developed in the 1960s and retains some of that countercultural charm. Pokhara's position in a valley creates its own microclimate, often clearer than Kathmandu.

### Day 56: Sundarbans → Khulna — *October 26, 2027*
**Return to civilization**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 136 km |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Khulna |

- Morning: Final Sundarbans exploration
- Return to Khulna
- Evening: Local market

Khulna is Bangladesh's third-largest city and the gateway to the Sundarbans. Positioned at the confluence of the Rupsha and Bhairab rivers, the city developed as an important trading post during British rule. Today it's primarily an industrial center (jute, textiles, shipbuilding) but retains its role as the launching point for Sundarbans expeditions. The city is known for its abundance of rickshaws and the unique painted designs that decorate them - a folk art tradition specific to Bangladesh.

Morning exploration of the outer Sundarbans channels before returning upriver to Khulna. Retrieve the vehicle and check into hotel. Afternoon at leisure exploring the city - the riverside provides views of the traditional wooden boat traffic. Evening visit to the local markets where fresh fish from the Sundarbans and local produce create a vibrant atmosphere. Khulna in late October: 28-32°C, humid but the city is less intense than Dhaka.

### Day 57: Khulna → Dhaka — *October 27, 2027*
**Return north**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 204 km |
| **Driving** | 4 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Dhaka |

- Drive back to Dhaka
- Afternoon: Any missed sights
- Prepare for coast journey

The drive from Khulna to Dhaka crosses Bangladesh's agricultural heartland, where the landscape is dominated by rice paddies (Bangladesh is the world's fourth-largest rice producer), fish ponds, and jute fields. The region experiences three rice-growing seasons per year thanks to monsoon rains and fertile delta soil. Most of the population works in agriculture or related industries, and the drive provides constant views of traditional farming life - ox-drawn plows, hand-harvesting, and roadside markets selling fresh produce.

Depart Khulna and drive northeast on the Dhaka-Khulna highway. The road is generally good with the Padma Multipurpose Bridge (opened 2022) significantly shortening the journey. Allow extra time for traffic approaching Dhaka. Afternoon free to revisit favorite spots or explore anything missed earlier. Consider New Market or Dhaka University area. Evening preparation for the long drive to Cox's Bazar tomorrow. Late October in Dhaka: 28-32°C, humidity remains high.

### Day 58: Dhaka → Cox's Bazar — *October 28, 2027*
**World's longest beach**

![Cox's Bazar Beach](data/pois/images/bd/cox-s-bazar-beach-1.webp)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 393 km |
| **Driving** | 7 hrs |
| **Stay** | Beach resort - Cox's Bazar (2 nights) |

- Long drive southeast
- Arrive at 120 km unbroken sandy beach
- Evening: Beach sunset

Cox's Bazar is home to the world's longest natural unbroken sea beach - 120 kilometers of continuous sandy coastline along the Bay of Bengal. The town is named after Captain Hiram Cox, a British East India Company officer who died here in 1799. Before tourism, the area was known for its salt production and dried fish industry. The beach slopes gently into warm waters, making it safe for swimming. Today it's Bangladesh's top tourist destination, visited by millions of Bangladeshis annually, though it remains relatively unknown internationally.

Early departure from Dhaka heading southeast. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway is Bangladesh's busiest road with heavy truck traffic. Beyond Chittagong the road improves and traffic thins as the route follows the coast. Arrival at Cox's Bazar by late afternoon with time for a first beach sunset - the wide sandy beach stretches north and south as far as the eye can see. Fresh seafood dinner at one of the beachfront restaurants. Late October: 29-32°C with warm water temperatures ideal for swimming.

### Day 59: Cox's Bazar — *October 29, 2027*
**Rest day - Beach**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | Local excursions |
| **Stay** | Beach resort - Cox's Bazar |

- Laboni Beach
- Himchari waterfall
- Inani Beach (quieter, golden sand)
- Seafood dinner

The Cox's Bazar coastline offers distinct beach experiences. Laboni Beach is the main tourist beach with facilities and activity. Himchari, 12 kilometers south, features a waterfall tumbling directly onto the beach during monsoon (reduced flow by October but still scenic). Inani Beach, 30 kilometers south, is dramatically quieter with golden sand and coral-rock formations at low tide. The Rakhine (Arakanese) Buddhist community in nearby Ramu adds cultural diversity to the predominantly Muslim region, with several centuries-old Buddhist temples.

Full beach day with local explorations. Morning swim at Laboni Beach when it's quieter. Mid-morning drive to Himchari National Park to see the waterfall and hillside views. Continue to Inani Beach for lunch at a simple seafood shack overlooking the golden sand. Optional detour to Ramu to visit the Buddhist temples and bronze Buddha statues. Return to Cox's Bazar for evening sunset and fresh seafood dinner. Late October: 29-32°C with pleasant evening breezes off the Bay of Bengal.

### Day 60: Cox's Bazar → Chittagong — *October 30, 2027*
**Port city & shipping**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 141 km |
| **Driving** | 2.5 hrs |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Chittagong |

- Morning: Final beach time
- Drive to Chittagong
- Arrange vehicle shipping
- Ship breaks beach (unique sight)

Chittagong is Bangladesh's principal seaport and second-largest city, handling 92% of the country's maritime trade. The city has a long history as a trading hub - Arab merchants arrived in the 9th century, followed by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Just north of the city lies Sitakunda, site of the world's largest ship-breaking yards, where retired ocean vessels are dismantled by hand on the tidal flats. This controversial industry recycles millions of tons of steel annually under hazardous conditions but provides employment for thousands and fascinating (if sobering) industrial scenery.

Morning final swim and breakfast at Cox's Bazar before departing for Chittagong. The coastal road offers sea views. Arrive Chittagong by early afternoon and begin vehicle shipping logistics at the port - identify the shipping agent, confirm Carnet processing, and schedule loading. Late afternoon excursion north to Sitakunda to view the ship-breaking yards from the road (up close access restricted). Return to Chittagong for dinner. Late October: 29-32°C, humidity high near the coast.

## Week 10: Shipping & Departure

### Day 61-62: Chittagong — *October 31 - November 1, 2027*
**Vehicle shipping**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Driving** | Port logistics |
| **Stay** | Hotel - Chittagong |

- Clear paperwork for shipping
- Car loaded onto ship to Thailand
- Explore Chittagong (Foy's Lake, Ethnological Museum)

Shipping a vehicle from Chittagong to Thailand (Laem Chabang port) typically requires roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) service or container shipping. The route crosses the Bay of Bengal and enters the Andaman Sea, with transit time of approximately 10-14 days depending on the vessel and stops. Chittagong port is notoriously bureaucratic, and engaging a reputable shipping agent is essential. All personal items must be removed from the vehicle, the fuel tank should be nearly empty, and the battery disconnected. Carnet de Passage must be properly processed by customs.

Day 61: Full day of vehicle shipping logistics. Meet with shipping agent, complete customs formalities, and have Carnet stamped for export. Vehicle inspected and loaded. This process typically takes an entire day with much waiting. Day 62: Follow up on paperwork if needed in the morning. Afternoon free to explore Chittagong - Foy's Lake offers a peaceful escape, the Ethnological Museum documents Bangladesh's tribal peoples, and the old quarter has colonial architecture. Halloween in Chittagong (October 31): 28-31°C, no local celebration. Early November similar.

---

### Day 63: Fly Home — *November 2, 2027*
**Chittagong → Dhaka → Singapore**

- Domestic flight to Dhaka
- International flight home
- Vehicle on ship to Laem Chabang

Chittagong's Shah Amanat International Airport offers limited international connections, making a transit through Dhaka necessary for most destinations. The domestic flight is approximately 45 minutes. From Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, multiple airlines serve Singapore including Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines (via Kuala Lumpur), and Thai Airways (via Bangkok). The flight home concludes nine weeks of overland travel across the Indian subcontinent while the Land Cruiser continues its journey by sea.

Morning checkout from Chittagong hotel and transfer to the airport. Domestic flight to Dhaka where connecting time should allow for a meal at the international terminal. Evening international flight home to Singapore. The vehicle will arrive at Laem Chabang, Thailand approximately 10-14 days later and will be stored until Trip 3 pickup. Trip 2 complete: 63 days, 3 countries, 17,460 kilometers driven. November 2: 28-30°C in Chittagong/Dhaka, 27-31°C arriving Singapore.

### Buffer: Days 64-70 — *November 3-9, 2027*
**Contingency**

- Built-in buffer for delays
- Weather issues
- Visa complications
- Recovery time

Every overland journey encounters unexpected delays. In the Indian subcontinent, common issues include vehicle breakdowns (parts availability varies), visa extensions needed due to slower-than-expected travel, border delays (especially during festivals or political events), and health issues requiring rest. Monsoon remnants can cause flooding into October, and strikes (bandh) occasionally shut down transportation. A seven-day buffer provides flexibility without over-engineering the schedule.

This buffer accommodates delays anywhere in the trip. If unused, the extra days can extend time in favorite locations or allow earlier return home. Potential uses: extra day in Varanasi during festival season, additional acclimatization in Nepal, extended Sundarbans exploration, or simply recovery time from travel fatigue. If significant delays occur, contact shipping agent to adjust vehicle pickup timeline in Thailand. Early November in Bangladesh: 26-30°C, decreasing humidity, pleasant conditions.
